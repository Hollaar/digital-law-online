<ul>
  <li>Page 35, first paragraph: On January 15, 2003, the 
  Supreme Court upheld the Copyright Term Extension Act. See <i>
  <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-618.ZS.html">Eldred v. 
  Ashcroft</a></i>.</li>

</ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Page 44-45. In addition to contributory infringement and 
  vicarious infringement, there is another form of indirect infringement: 
  inducement of infringement. This was more commonly seen in patent law, because 
  it is specifically indicated in the patent statutes (17 U.S.C. 271(b)), but as 
  I noted in my paper &quot;<a href="http://digital-law-online.info/papers/lah/sony-revisited.htm" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Sony 
  Revisited: A new look at contributory copyright infringement</a>,&quot; is also 
  applicable to copyright. This was confirmed in the Supreme Court’s unanimous 
  opinion in 
  <a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-480.ZS.html">
  <i>MGM v. Grokster</a></i>, which stated:</p>
  <blockquote>
  For the same reasons that Sony took the staple-article doctrine of patent law 
  as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a 
  sensible one for copyright. We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes 
  a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown 
  by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, 
  is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While cases in patent law provide some guidance 
  regarding what might be inducement of infringement, the metes-and-bounds of 
  copyright inducement won’t be known until a few cases are litigated.<p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Page 51, add the following:</li>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, Congress added another form of criminal copyright 
infringement to Section 506, as part of criminalizing the videotaping of a 
motion picture playing in a theater and then distributing it on the Internet, 
which had become a significant problem. <span class=footnote>{FN88: “Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005, or the “ART Act,” part of “Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005,” Pub. L. 109-9, 119 Stat. 220}</span> </p>
<blockquote>Any person who willfully infringes a copyright shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18, if the infringement was committed-- . . . (C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if  such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution. <span class=footnote>{FN89: 17 U.S.C. 506(a)(1)}</span>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a problem with this provision. As I discuss in <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise30.html#secI.B.1.a.">Chapter 3, Section I.B.1.a</a>, the public distribution right covers only the distribution of material objects. And making something “available on a computer network accessible to members of the public,” without more, most certainly doesn’t distribute a material copy anywhere.</p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting that this approach was suggested by some of us in 1997 as an alternative to the “No Electronic Theft” Act <span class=footnote>{FN90: Pub. L. No. 105-147, 111 Stat. 2678, among other things adding subsection (a)(2) to 17 U.S.C. 506}</span>  in response to the LaMacchia decision. <span class=footnote>{FN91:
<i>United States v. LaMacchia</i>,
<a HREF="lpdi1.0/cases/33PQ2D1978.htm">871 F.Supp. 535</a>, 
<a HREF="lpdi1.0/cases/33PQ2D1978.htm">33 USPQ2d 1978</a> (D. Mass. 1994)} The concern was that it would be difficult to show when the required dollar amount of copies had been made before charging the crime, and it made little sense to wait until enough copies had gone out to stop the infringement. But we also wanted to amend the distribution right to include making the work available to the public, as discussed in <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise30.html#secI.B.1.f.">Chapter 3, Section I.B.1.f</a>.]

  <li>Page 217, replace the two paragraphs starting with &quot;During the first 
  review ...&quot; with:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p class=Paragraph>In July 2010, the fourth cycle completed with the following
exemptions:</p>

  <blockquote>

<p class=BlockQuote>(1) Motion pictures on DVDs that are lawfully made and
acquired and that are protected by the Content Scrambling System when
circumvention is accomplished solely in order to accomplish the incorporation
of short portions of motion pictures into new works for the purpose of
criticism or comment, and where the person engaging in circumvention believes
and has reasonable grounds for believing that circumvention is necessary to
fulfill the purpose of the use in the following instances:<br>
(i)&nbsp; Educational uses by college and university
professors and by college and university film and media studies students;<br>
(ii) Documentary filmmaking;<br>
(iii) Noncommercial videos.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(2) Computer programs that enable wireless telephone
handsets to execute software applications, where circumvention is accomplished
for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of such applications, when
they have been lawfully obtained, with computer programs on the telephone
handset.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(3) Computer programs, in the form of firmware or software,
that enable used wireless telephone handsets to connect to a wireless
telecommunications network, when circumvention is initiated by the owner of the
copy of the computer program solely in order to connect to a wireless
telecommunications network and access to the network is authorized by the
operator of the network. </p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(4) Video games accessible on personal computers and
protected by technological protection measures that control access to lawfully
obtained works, when circumvention is accomplished solely for the purpose of
good faith testing for, investigating, or correcting security flaws or
vulnerabilities, if:<br>
(i)&nbsp; The information derived from the security testing
is used primarily to promote the security of the owner or operator of a
computer, computer system, or computer network; and<br>
(ii) The information derived from the security testing is used or maintained in
a manner that does not facilitate copyright infringement or a violation of
applicable law.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(5) Computer programs protected by dongles that prevent
access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete.&nbsp; A dongle
shall be considered obsolete if it is no longer manufactured or if a
replacement or repair is no longer reasonably available in the commercial
marketplace; and</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(6) Literary works distributed in ebook format when all
existing ebook editions of the work (including digital text editions made available
by authorized entities) contain access controls that prevent the enabling
either of the book’s read-aloud function or of screen readers that render the
text into a specialized format.</p>

  </blockquote>

<p class=Paragraph>It must be remembered that the exemptions are only for the
circumvention of an access control mechanism covered by section 1201(a)(1). It
does not provide an exemption for the provision of a tool used for such
circumvention, which could be a violation of section 1201(a)(2), nor for
circumvention that results in infringement, which would be a violation of
section 1201(b).</p>

proceedings leading up to them, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The treatise does not discuss the special subpoena provisions of the DMCA 
  that a content owner can used to obtain the name and address of a user from an 
  Internet Service Provider. In particular,
  <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512">17 U.S.C. 512(h)</a> 
  provides that a subpoena could be requested from the clerk of any United 
  States District Court, without the requirement of filing a copyright 
  infringement suit:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    (1) Request. — A copyright owner or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf may 
    request the clerk of any United States district court to issue a subpoena to 
    a service provider for identification of an alleged infringer in accordance 
    with this subsection.<br>
    (2) Contents of request — The request may be made by filing with the clerk—<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) a copy of a notification described in subsection (c)(3)(A);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) a proposed subpoena; and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) a sworn declaration to the effect that the 
      purpose for which the subpoena is sought is to obtain the identity of an 
      alleged infringer and that such information will only be used for the 
      purpose of protecting rights under this title.
  </blockquote>

<p>Congress included this provision so that it would not be necessary for a 
copyright owner to file a &quot;John Doe&quot; lawsuit to obtain the name of a user, which 
might then have to be dismissed and refiled in the proper venue after the 
location of the user was determined, thereby lowering litigation costs that 
might eventually have to be paid by the user. Critics have said that it would 
allow stalkers to pretend to be a copyright owner in order to get the name and 
address of a user, because there is no effective review of the subpoena request 
by the court clerk.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2003, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, in
<a href="riaaverizon121903.pdf">RIAA v. Verizon</a>, held that the subpoena 
provisions were not applicable to service providers acting as &quot;<a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise35.html">mere 
conduits</a>,&quot; since the notice provision makes no sense in that context. It is 
likely that the RIAA will seek remedial legislation by Congress, which will be 
discussed here when it is introduced.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4 --</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Section 4.V. (pages 266-276) discusses &quot;Novelty&quot; and what constitutes 
  &quot;prior art.&quot;&nbsp; The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA, Public Law No: 
  112-29) substantially that, effective March 16, 2013, although the past 
  definitions remain in effect for patents whose applications were filed before 
  then.&nbsp; The new definitions for prior art are discussed in &quot;<a href="treatise-supplement-priorart.pdf">Prior 
  art under the new patent reform act</a>.&quot;</li>
  <li>Page 289, replace the paragraph starting &quot;The patent statute&nbsp;...&quot;
  and the paragraph that follows it on page 290 with:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patent statute was changed in 1999 
  to permit the reexamination requestor to participate in the reexamination by 
  providing written commentary on the actions of the examiner and the responses 
  of the patent owner. Further changes were made in 2002 to give the requestor 
  the same appeals rights as the patent owner. Previously, while either party 
  could appeal the examiner’s decision to the Board of Patent Appeals and 
  Interferences, only patent owner could further appeal the decision of the 
  Board to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another change in 2002 allowed the 
  reexamination to be based on prior art already considered by the examiner, as 
  long as a “substantial new question of patentability” is shown. But Congress 
  made it clear that this is not a way to second-guess the examiner.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this bill is not a license to abuse 
    patentees and waste the life of a patent. The point must be stressed that 
    the past requirement of ‘a substantial new question of patentability’ has 
    not been diminished. The issue raised must be more that just questioning the 
    judgment of the examiner. There should be substantial evidence that the 
    examiner did not properly understand the reference, or did not consider a 
    portion of the reference in making his decision. That substantial new 
    question must be put forward clearly in the request for reexamination. The 
    bill preserves the necessary safeguard in the Patent Act against harassment 
    of patentees with the safety-valve of a ‘substantial new question of 
    patentability’ standard, not merely ‘any sort of question.’ The agency has 
    discretion in this determination to permit reexamination, but it is not 
    absolute. While the bill clarifies the basis for a reexamination 
    determination and removes the overly-strict bar established by the court, 
    which renders the available process useless in many obvious instances such 
    as with previously considered prior art, the courts should judiciously 
    interpret the ‘substantial new question’ standard to prevent cases of 
    abusive tactics and harassment of patentees through reexamination.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reexamination provision prevents 
  you from using anything that you could have brought up at the time of the 
  reexamination in later litigation. Because of uncertainty about the scope of 
  this bar, reexamination may be undesirable unless you have prior art that you 
  are sure will invalidate the patent, or at least cause new claims that will 
  not concern you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though each revision to reexamination 
  makes an important improvement, there are still problems that keep people from 
  taking advantage of reexamination as an alternative to litigation. Perhaps 
  Congress will see this as reason to institute a simplified early 
  reexamination, such as an opposition period for a short time after the 
  issuance of a patent to weed out patents where the best prior art was 
  unavailable to the examiner.</p>

  The recent <i><a href="cases/bilski-slip-opinion.pdf">Bilski</a></i> and <i>
  <a href="cases/alice-slip-opinion.pdf">Alice</a></i> decisions by the Supreme 
  Court has reopened the question of when a software-based invention is

    long-awaited <i><a href="cases/bilski-slip-opinion.pdf">Bilski</a></i> 
    decision, holding that a claim to a commodities hedging strategy was 
    unpatentable because it was “abstract.” But while four justices would find 
    business methods unpatentable, the Court did not go that far, saying that 
    “Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention that the term 
    ‘process’ categorically excludes business methods.” It also rejected the 
    “particular machine or transformation” test that the Federal Circuit had 
    stated in the case as not the exclusive test, although it is a good clue to 
    patentability.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">And on June 19, 2014, the Supreme Court added to the 
    confusion in its <i><a href="cases/alice-slip-opinion.pdf">Alice</a></i> 
    opinion, finding another business method to be an unpatentable “abstract 
    idea,” even when it was claimed as a tangible machine. It appears that for 
    business methods, the Court is has returned to the past where, as Justice 
    Jackson noted, “<a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/quotes/fn5-9.htm#q">the 
    only patent that is valid is one which this Court has not been able to get

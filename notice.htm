<h3 align="center">&nbsp;<b>Copyright</b></h3>
<p class="Paragraph">Although there are no restrictions on accessing this online 
version, it is a work protected by the copyright laws of the United States and 
in Berne Convention countries. That copyright does not extend its reproduction 
of statutes, court cases, and other United States government works, but it does 
cover the selection of the particular cases and quotes and the original material 
in the treatise.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">You are free to make any copies needed to view the online 
version. You can print out the pages for your own use. But there is one thing 
that I ask – please do not redistribute this material on your own web site. 
Instead, just refer people to this web site. That way, I don’t have to be 
concerned about versions floating around that have not been updated to reflect 
the latest changes in the law.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">If you do want save a copy of this web site for your 
personal use, be sure to regularly check the errata and update pages so that you 
are aware of any changes that may make your personal copy obsolete.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Finally, my agreement with BNA Books gives them the 
exclusive right to publish and distribute a printed version of this treatise.</p>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;<b>Disclaimer</b></h3>
<p class="Paragraph">The material is intended to provide my view of the current 
state of the law protecting digital information. It is not being offered as 
legal advice, and if you have a specific legal question, you should contact an 
attorney qualified by both experience and bar membership to provide legal 
advice.</p>
<h3 align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>Linking</b></h3>
<p class="Paragraph">
You can link to any page of this online treatise. However, for the next few months,
it will be undergoing revisions to its underlying structure and I can't promise
that any particular page will continue to have the same name or content.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The sure-fire way to direct people to a part of the treatise is to link to the main treatise page
(<a href="http://digital-law-online.info">www.digital-law-online.info</a>) 
and tell them to go to the complete table of contents for the treatise. There, 
they can click on the entry for the particular part of the treatise of interest, 
and be taken there regardless of the internal organization of the online 
treatise.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">I am looking at ways of specifying links that will give you 
either the current version of a particular part of the treatise, or its version 
at some time in the past. When that is available, the instructions for using it 
will be available here.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Paragraph">I hope that you will find this online treatise useful!

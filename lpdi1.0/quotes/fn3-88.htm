<h1>III. Discussion</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in Title I implements the World Intellectual Property (WIPO) treaties on copyright and on performers and phonograms, and in Title II limits the copyright infringement liability of on-line and Internet service providers (OSPs and ISPs) under certain circumstances. The DMCA also provides in Title III a minor but important clarification of copyright law that the lawful owner or lessee of a computer may authorize someone to turn on their computer for the purposes of maintenance or repair. Title IV addresses the issues of ephemeral recordings, distance education, and digital preservation for libraries and archives.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Due to the ease with which digital works can be copied and distributed worldwide virtually instantaneously, copyright owners will hesitate to make their works readily available on the Internet without reasonable assurance that they will be protected against massive piracy. Legislation implementing the treaties provides this protection and creates the legal platform for launching the global digital on-line marketplace for copyrighted works. It will facilitate making available quickly and conveniently via the Internet the movies, music, software, and literary works that are the fruit of American creative genius. It will also encourage the continued growth of the existing off-line global marketplace for copyrighted works in digital format by setting strong international copyright standards.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>At the same time, without clarification of their liability, service providers may hesitate to make the necessary investment in the expansion of the speed and capacity of the Internet. In the ordinary course of their operations service providers must engage in all kinds of acts that expose them to potential copyright infringement liability. For example, service providers must make innumerable electronic copies by simply transmitting information over the Internet. Certain electronic copies are made to speed up the delivery of information to users. Other electronic copies are made in order to host World Wide Web sites. Many service providers engage in directing users to sites in response to inquiries by users or they volunteer sites that users may find attractive. Some of these sites might contain infringing material. In short, by limiting the liability of service providers, the DMCA ensures that the efficiency of the Internet will continue to improve and that the variety and quality of services on the Internet will continue to expand.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Besides the major copyright owners and the major OSP’s and ISP’s (e.g., the local telephone companies, the long distance carriers, <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 9&gt;</span><A name="Page9"></A> America OnLine, etc.), the Committee heard from representatives of individual copyright owners and small ISP’s, from representatives of libraries, archives and educational institutions, from representatives of broadcasters, computer hardware manufacturers, and consumers. Title II, for example, reflects 3 months of negotiations supervised by Chairman Hatch and assisted by Senator Ashcroft among the major copyright owners and the major OSP’s and ISP’s. Intense discussions took place on distance education too, with the participation of representatives of libraries, teachers, and educational institutions, under the supervision of Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, Senator Ashcroft, and the Copyright Office.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>As a result, the Committee took substantial steps to refine the discussion draft that Chairman Hatch laid down before the Committee through a series of amendments, each of which was adopted unanimously. For example, the current legislation contains: (1) a provision to ensure that parents will be able to protect their children from pornography and other inappropriate material on the Internet; (2) provisions to provide for the updating of the copyright laws so that educators, libraries, and archives will be able to take advantage of the promise of digital technology; (3) important procedural protections for individual Internet users to ensure that they will not be mistakenly denied access to the World Wide Web; (4) provisions to ensure that the current practice of legitimate reverse engineering for software interoperability may continue; and (5) provisions to accommodate the needs of broadcasters for ephemeral recordings and regarding copyright management information. These provisions are in addition to provisions Chairman Hatch had already incorporated into the discussion draft, such as provisions on library browsing, provisions addressing the special needs of individual creators regarding copyright management information, and provisions exempting nonprofit archives, nonprofit educational institutions, and nonprofit libraries from criminal penalties and, in the case of civil penalties, remitting damages entirely when such an institution was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Consequently, the DMCA enjoys widespread support from the motion picture, recording, software, and publishing industries, as well as the telephone companies, long distance carriers, and other OSP’s and ISP’s. It is also supported by the Information Technology Industry Council, which includes the leading computer hardware manufacturers, and by representatives of individual creators, such as the Writers Guild, the Directors Guild, the Screen Actors Guild, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The breadth of support for this bill is reflected in the unanimous roll call vote (18 0) by which the DMCA was reported out of Committee.</p>

<h2>Title I</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>Title I implements the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. These treaties were concluded by the Clinton administration in December 1996. The treaties are best understood as supplements to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. The Berne Convention is the leading multilateral treaty on copyright and related <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 10&gt;</span><A name="Page10"></A> rights, with 130 countries adhering to it. The United States ratified the Berne Convention in 1989. The two new WIPO treaties were adopted at a diplomatic conference by a consensus of over 150 countries. In general, the Copyright Treaty updates the Berne Convention for digital works and the growth of the Internet and other digital communications networks, and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty supplements the Berne Convention with comprehensive copyright protection for performances and sound recordings (called “phonograms” in international parlance).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The importance of the treaties to the protection of American copyrighted works abroad cannot be overestimated. The treaties, as well as the Berne Convention, are based on the principle of national treatment; that is, that adhering countries are obliged to grant the same protection to foreign works that they grant to domestic works. Even more importantly, the Berne Convention and the treaties set minimum standards of protection. Thus, the promise of the treaties is that, in an increasing global digital marketplace, U.S. copyright owners will be able to rely upon strong, non-discriminatory copyright protection in most of the countries of the world.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The copyright industries are one of America’s largest and fastest growing economic assets. According to International Intellectual Property Alliance statistics, in 1996 (when the last full set of figures was available), the U.S. creative industries accounted for 3.65 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)–$278.4 billion. In the last 20 years (1977 1996), the U.S. copyright industries’ share of GDP grew more than twice as fast as the remainder of the economy–5.5 percent vs. 2.6 percent. Between 1977 and 1996, employment in the U.S. copyright industries more than doubled to 3.5 million workers–2.8 percent of total U.S. employment. Between 1977 and 1996 U.S. copyright industry employment grew nearly three times as fast as the annual rate of the economy as a whole–4.6 percent vs. 1.6 percent. In fact, the copyright industries contribute more to the U.S. economy and employ more workers than any single manufacturing sector, including chemicals, industrial equipment, electronics, food processing, textiles and apparel, and aircraft. More significantly for the WIPO treaties, in 1996 U.S. copyright industries achieved foreign sales and exports of $60.18 billion, for the first time leading all major industry sectors, including agriculture, automobiles and auto parts, and the aircraft industry.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The WIPO treaties contain many important provisions. For example, the Copyright Treaty contains significant provisions such as: (1) explicit recognition that computer programs are covered by the Berne Convention; (2) recognition of a broad right of public distribution; (3) recognition of a broad right of communication to the public that includes the Internet; (4) an official statement that interprets the existing reproduction right of the Berne Convention to “fully apply in the digital environment”;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=FNRef>16</span></a> (5) an obligation to provide “legal protection and effective legal remedies” against circumventing technological measures, e.g. encryption and password protection, that are used by copyright owners to protect their works <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 11&gt;</span><A name="Page11"></A> from piracy;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=FNRef>17</span></a> and (6) an obligation to provide “adequate and effective legal remedies” to preserve the integrity of “rights management information.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=FNRef>18</span></a> The Performances and Phonograms Treaty recognizes certain rights of performers over their performances and basically gives the copyright owners of sound recordings the same protection for their works as exist in the Berne Convention for other works.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee believes that in order to adhere to the WIPO treaties, legislation is necessary in two primary areas–anticircumvention of technological protection measures and protection of the integrity of rights management information, or “copyright management information” (CMI), as it is referred to in the bill. This view is shared by the Clinton administration. In drafting implementing legislation for the WIPO treaties, the Committee has sought to address those two areas, as well as avoid government regulation of the Internet and encourage technological solutions. The Committee is keenly aware that other countries will use U.S. legislation as a model.</p>

<h3>A. Anticircumvention</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Title I encourages technological solutions, in general, by enforcing private parties’ use of technological protection measures with legal sanctions for circumvention and for producing and distributing products or providing services that are aimed at circumventing technological protection measures that effectively protect copyrighted works. For example, if unauthorized access to a copyrighted work is effectively prevented through use of a password, it would be a violation of this section to defeat or bypass the password and to make the means to do so, as long as the primary purpose of the means was to perform this kind of act.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=FNRef>19</span></a> This is roughly analogous to making it illegal to break into a house using a tool, the primary purpose of which is to break into houses.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Legislation prohibiting circumvention devices is not unprecedented. The Copyright Act in section 1002(c) already protects sound recordings and musical works by prohibiting devices which circumvent any program or circuit that implements a serial copy management system or similar system included in digital audio recording devices and digital audio interface devices. The Communications Act in section 605(e)(4) prohibits devices that are “primarily of assistance in the unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming.” In addition to the WIPO Copyright Treaty, the NAFTA in article 1707(b) requires each party to make it a criminal offense to make available a device or system that is “primarily of assistance in decoding an encrypted program-carrying <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 12&gt;</span><A name="Page12"></A> satellite signal without the authorization of the lawful distributor of such signal.’</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Although sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) of the bill are worded similarly and employ similar tests, they are designed to protect two distinct rights and to target two distinct classes of devices. Subsection 1201(a)(2) is designed to protect access to a copyrighted work. Section 1201(b) is designed to protect the traditional copyright rights of the copyright owner. As a consequence, subsection 1201(a)(2) prohibits devices primarily designed to circumvent effective technological measures that limit access to a work. Subsection 1201(b), on the other hand, prohibits devices primarily designed to circumvent effective technological protection measures that limit the ability of the copyrighted work to be copied, or otherwise protect the copyright rights of the owner of the copyrighted work. The two sections are not interchangeable, and many devices will be subject to challenge only under one of the subsections. For example, if an effective technological protection measure does nothing to prevent access to the plain text of the work, but is designed to prevent that work from being copied, then a potential cause of action against the manufacturer of a device designed to circumvent the measure lies under subsection 1201(b), but not under subsection 1201(a)(2). Conversely, if an effective technological protection measure limits access to the plain text of a work only to those with authorized access, but provides no additional protection against copying, displaying, performing or distributing the work, then a potential cause of action against the manufacturer of a device designed to circumvent the measure lies under subsection 1201(a)(2), but not under subsection 1201(b).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This, in turn, is the reason there is no prohibition on conduct in 1201(b) akin to the prohibition on circumvention conduct in 1201(a)(1). The prohibition in 1201(a)(1) is necessary because prior to this Act, the conduct of circumvention was never before made unlawful. The device limitation in 1201(a)(2) enforces this new prohibition on conduct. The copyright law has long forbidden copyright infringements, so no new prohibition was necessary. The device limitation in 1201(b) enforces the longstanding prohibitions on infringements.</p>

<h4>Accommodation of particular technological protection measures</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee was concerned that the provisions of subsections 1201(a)(2) and (b) might be read to mandate that manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computing products design their products and components to respond to particular technological protection measures employed to protect copyrighted works. Subsection 1201(d)(3) addresses this concern and clarifies that section 1201 does not impose any affirmative design mandates on manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computing products. The fact that a product or component does not respond to any particular technological protection measure, standing alone, neither creates liability under section 1201 nor immunizes those trafficking in the product, part or component from liability. This provision recognizes that there may be legitimate reasons for a product or component’s failure to respond to a particular technological measure–such as design efficiency or ensuring high <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 13&gt;</span><A name="Page13"></A> quality output from the product–as well as illegitimate reasons–such as an unlawful intent to circumvent the protection measure.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>That a component or part’s failure to respond to a technological measure does not immunize the product or component from further review under section 1201 is made clear by the following example. Suppose a device expressly intended to circumvent an effective technological protection measure commonly employed to protect copyrighted works contained a component that was critical to the effectiveness of the device in achieving its stated purpose. Suppose further that the product was marketed as a circumvention device and had no commercially significant purposes or use other than to circumvent. That component would not provide the desired response to the effective technological protection measure, but the product would still clearly run afoul of section 1201 in light of the device manufacturer’s unlawful intent, the marketing strategy and the lack of other commercially significant uses for the product.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>On the other hand, suppose a manufacturer of a state-of-the-art consumer electronics device, which did not circumvent any technological protection measure when it was introduced into the market and which was designed and marketed for a purpose other than circumventing any technological protection measures, was sued for violating section 1201 because the device did not accommodate a particular technological protection measure developed after the device was designed and sold. In such a case, section 1201(d)(3) would make it clear that the device’s failure to accommodate this new protection measure does not render the device unlawful, and in light of the nature of the product, the manner in which it functions, the way it had been marketed and its obvious legitimate uses (assuming the device continues to be marketed and produced for the same legitimate uses), there would clearly be no basis for arguing that the device was unlawful under section 1201.</p>

<h4>Library browsing</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 1201(e) allows nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions to gain access to a commercially exploited copyrighted work solely to make the determination of whether to acquire a copy of the work.</p>

<h4>Reverse engineering</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>Sections 1201(g) (j) are intended to allow legitimate software developers to continue engaging in certain activities for the purpose of achieving interoperability to the extent permitted by law prior to the enactment of this chapter. The objective is to ensure that the effect of current case law interpreting the Copyright Act is not changed by enactment of this legislation for certain acts of identification and analysis done in respect of computer programs. <i>See, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v Accolade, Inc.,</i> 977 F.2d 1510, 24 U.S.P.Q.2d 1561 (9th Cir. 1992.). The purpose of this section is to foster competition and innovation in the computer and software industry.</p>

<h4>Controlling the access of minors to material on the Internet</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee supports the voluntary efforts underway by a broad group of Internet users, library groups, publishers and other <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 14&gt;</span><A name="Page14"></A> copyright industry groups, family-focused organizations, on-line service providers, and civil liberties groups to empower parents to supervise and control the material their children access from the Internet. Nothing in this bill is intended to undercut these efforts.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>To emphasize this point, an amendment (section 1201(k)) sponsored by Senator Ashcroft, Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy was adopted unanimously by the Committee to ensure that the prohibitions in section 1201(a) did not inadvertently make it unlawful for parents to protect their children from pornography and other inappropriate material available on the Internet, or have unintended legal consequences for manufacturers of products designed solely to enable parents to protect their children in this fashion. Section 1201(k) makes clear that in a suit brought under section 1201(a), a court may consider the necessity for a challenged component or part’s intended and actual incorporation into a technology, product, service or device, which does not itself violate the provisions of new chapter 12 on Copyright Protection and Management Systems, and which has the sole purpose of preventing the access of minors to pornography or other inappropriate material on the Internet. This provision applies to subsection 1201(a) in its entirety (as opposed to subsection 1201(a)(2) alone) in order to clarify that the bill protects the actions of parents in ensuring that their children do not have access to inappropriate material on-line.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>A variety of tools available now allow parents to exercise control in a manner consistent with their own family values, of their children’s access to online materials. In the event that, in the future, any of these tools incorporates a part or component which circumvents a technological protection measure effectively controlling access to a copyrighted work solely in order to provide a parent with the information necessary to ascertain whether that material is appropriate for his or her child, this provision authorizes a court to take into consideration the necessity for incorporating such part or component in a suit alleging a violation of section 1201(a).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This provision is limited to the application of subsection (a) because the Committee does not anticipate that it would be necessary for parental empowerment tools to make copies of questionable material, or to distribute or perform it, in order to carry out their important function of assisting parents in guiding their children on the Internet. Accordingly, circumvention of copy controls, or of similar measures, should never be a necessary capability of a parental empowerment tool. By the same token, if a technology, product, service or device which (1) has the sole purpose of preventing the access of minors to certain materials on the Internet, and (2) that technology, product, service or device circumvents a technological protection measure that effectively controls access to a work as defined in subsection 1201(a)(3) only for the purpose of gaining access to the work to ascertain whether it is suitable for a minor, but does not otherwise defeat any copy protection for that work, then that technology, product, service or device is only subject to challenge under subsection 1201(a)(2) and not subsection 1201(b). In such circumstances, no cause of action would lie under section 1201(b) and therefore limiting language would be unnecessary.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This provision is not to be interpreted to allow the wholesale access to copyrighted works in their entirety, but merely to allow parents <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 15&gt;</span><A name="Page15"></A> to have an ability to determine whether a work is inappropriate for that parent’s child.</p>

<h4>Encryption research</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>The purpose of the Committee in proposing enactment of section 1201 is to improve the ability of copyright owners to prevent the theft of their works, including by applying technological protection measures. The effectiveness of such measures depends in large part on the rapid and dynamic development of better technologies, including encryption-based technological protection measures. The development of encryption sciences requires, in part, ongoing research and testing activities by scientists of existing encryption methods, in order to build on those advances, thus promoting and advancing encryption technology generally.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The goals of section 1201 would be poorly served if these provisions had the undesirable and unintended consequence of chilling legitimate research activities in the area of encryption. It is the view of the Committee, after having conducted extensive consultations, and having examined a number of hypothetical situations, that Section 1201 should not have such an unintended negative effect.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>It is the view of the Committee that generally available encryption testing tools would not be made illegal by this Act. Each of those tools has a legitimate and substantial commercial purpose–testing security and effectiveness–and are not prohibited by Section 1201. In addition, the testing of specific encryption algorithms would not fall within the scope of 1201, since mathematical formulas as such are not protected by copyright. Thus, testing of an encryption algorithm or program that has multiple uses, including a use as a technical protection measure for copyrighted works, would not fall within the prohibition of section 1201(a) when that testing is performed on the encryption when it is in a form not implemented as a technical protection measure. Similarly, the testing of encryption technologies developed by or on behalf of the government of the United States, would not violate section 1201 since copyright does not subsist in such subject matter. Finally, there are many situations in which encryption research will be undertaken with the consent or at the direction of the copyright owner and therefore will not give rise to any action under section 1201.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>For these reasons, it is the view of the Committee that the following types of encryption testing are not generally prohibited by section 1201.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>If a cryptographer uses various cryptanalytic research techniques to discover a flaw in, for example, the U.S. government’s Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) used in the Clipper Chip and Fortezza cards. The flaw allows users to circumvent essential features of the algorithm. Since these encryption products are not covered by copyright, because they are merely mathematical algorithms in addition to being owned by the U.S. government, these acts do not violate 1201, and the results may be made available to the public.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>If a company, in the course of developing a new cryptographic product, sponsors a crypto-cracking contest with cash prizes, contestants would not violate section 1201 since the research acts are specifically authorized.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 16&gt;</span><A name="Page16"></A> Significantly, section 1201 does not make illegal cryptographic devices that have substantial legitimate purposes other than to circumvent technological protection measures as applied to a work. For example, many popular word processing and other computer programs include a security feature allowing users to password-protect documents (employing a low-grade form of encryption.) It is not uncommon for users of such products to forget or lose their passwords for such documents, making their own protected works unrecoverable. As a result, many independent programmers have created utilities designed to assist in the recovery of passwords or password-protected works. Several of these utilities are distributed over the Internet as freeware or shareware. Because these utilities have a substantial legitimate use, and because they would be used by persons to gain access to their own works, these devices do not violate section 1201.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The law would also not prohibit certain kinds of commercial “key-cracker” products, e.g., a computer program optimized to crack certain 40-bit encryption keys. Such machines are often rented to commercial customers for the purpose of quick data recovery of encrypted data. So long as these devices would have a substantial legitimate use, and they do not become principally used to facilitate infringement, they would not be prohibited by section 1201.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Today, network and web site management and security tools increasingly contain components that automatically test systems security and identify common vulnerabilities. These programs are valuable tools for systems administrators and web site operators, to use in the course of their regular testing of their systems’ security. Again, because these devices do not meet the test of section 1201, because they are good products put to a good use, the devices do not fall within the scope of this statute.</p>

<h3>B. Copyright Management Information</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Copyright Management Information (CMI) is an important element in establishing an efficient Internet marketplace in copyrighted works free from governmental regulation. Such information will assist in tracking and monitoring uses of copyrighted works, as well as licensing of rights and indicating attribution, creation and ownership.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Under the bill, CMI includes such items as the title of the work, the author, the copyright owner, and in some instances, the writer, performer, and director. CMI need not be in digital form, but CMI in digital form is expressly included. It is important to note that the DMCA does not <i>require</i> CMI, but if CMI is provided, the bill protects it from falsification, removal or alteration. Information that is not defined as CMI under the bill would not be protected by these provisions, although its removal or falsification might be protected under other laws, such as unfair trade. The definition of CMI may be expanded by regulation prescribed by the Register of Copyrights.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 1202(a) prohibits knowingly providing CMI that is false or knowingly distributing CMI that is false with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal infringement. Section 1202(b) prohibits (1) the intentional removal or alteration of CMI, (2) the distribution of CMI knowing that the information has been <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 17&gt;</span><A name="Page17"></A> removed or altered, and (3) the distribution or public performance of works knowing or having reason to know that CMI has been removed or altered, so long as, regarding the prohibited acts described in section 1202(b), there is knowledge or reasonable grounds to know that these acts will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 1202(e) recognizes special problems that certain broadcasting entities may have with the transmission of copyright management information. Under this subsection, radio and television broadcasters, cable systems, and persons who provide programming to such broadcasters or systems, who do not intend to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal infringement (eligible persons) may be eligible for a limitation on liability for violation of the copyright management information provisions of section 1202(b) in certain, limited circumstances.</p>

<h3>C. Civil Remedies And Criminal Penalties</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 1203 gives civil remedies and section 1204 imposes criminal penalties for violations of sections 1201 and 1202.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In addition to an award of damages, section 1203(b) provides for various kinds of affirmative relief in civil actions such as temporary and permanent injunctions, impoundment, and, as part of a final judgment or decree finding a violation, the court may order remedial modification or destruction of the offending device or product. Such affirmative relief is currently found in the Copyright Act for copyright infringements.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Regarding monetary relief, section 1203 provides for actual damages, profits derived from the unlawful activity, statutory damages, and treble damages for repeat offenders. Such monetary relief is available under the current Copyright Act.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>An important feature of section 1203 is the remittitur for innocent violators and for nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions. In the case of a violator who was not aware and had no reason to believe that the acts at issue constituted a violation, the court may reduce or remit the total award of damages. In the cases of nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions the court must remit damages if the institution was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The current Copyright Act provides for criminal penalties for copyright infringement. Section 1204 of the bill also provides criminal penalties for violations of section 1201(a) and (b). Specifically, willful violations of sections 1201 or 1202 for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain are punished by up to $500,000 in fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years. Repeat offenses are punishable by up to $1,000,000 in fines or imprisonment for up to 10 years. The bill requires that criminal proceedings be commenced within 5 years after the cause of action arose. Criminal penalties do not apply to nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions.</p>

<h3>D. Protecting Personal Privacy Interests</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 1205 responds to concerns expressed by some that certain technologies used to gather personally identifiable information <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 18&gt;</span><A name="Page18"></A> from Internet users could be characterized as technological protection measures for copyrighted materials, and that therefore efforts by Internet users to protect their privacy by disabling or bypassing such technologies could be prohibited by section 1201. The Committee does not believe that enactment of this legislation will have this effect. No specific example of such a privacy-invasive technology in use today that would be affected in this way has been called to the Committee’s attention. For example, even if “cookie” files–which are automatically deposited on the hard drives of computers of users who visit World Wide Web sites–are considered to be invasive of personal privacy (and are deemed to be copyrighted works), all commercially significant browser programs can be readily configured to reject “cookies,” and such a configuration raises no issue of any violation of section 1201.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In fact, enactment of section 1201 should have a positive impact on the protection of personal privacy on the Internet. The same technologies that copyright owners use to control access to and use of their works can and will be used to protect the personal privacy of Internet users by, for example, encrypting e-mail communications, or requiring a password for access to personal copyrighted information on an individual’s web site. By outlawing the activities of those who make it their business to provide the tools for circumventing these protective technologies, this legislation will substantially enhance the degree to which individuals may protect their privacy as they work, play and communicate on the Internet.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>However, because of the privacy concerns expressed that existing or future technologies may evolve in such a way that an individual would have to circumvent a technological protection measure to protect his or her privacy, the committee concluded that it was prudent to rule out any scenario in which section 1201 might be relied upon to make it harder, rather than easier, to protect personal privacy on the Internet. Accordingly, Senator Ashcroft, Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy proposed a savings clause to clarify that nothing in the new chapter 12 will abrogate, diminish or weaken the provisions of any Federal or State law that prevents the violation of an individual’s privacy in connection with the individual’s use of the Internet. The savings clause also specifies that section 1201 cannot be used to provide a defense, or an element of mitigation, in any civil or criminal action to enforce such a law. For example, if a valid Federal or State law regulates, on personal privacy grounds, the use of “cookie” files, which are automatically placed on the computer hard drives of users as they visit Internet web sites, and a party with standing sues to enforce the limitations contained in that law, the defendant may not excuse his actions in violation of those limitations by pointing to anything in chapter 12 of title 17.</p>

<h4>Law enforcement</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>Sections 1201(f) and 1202(d) create exceptions for the lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities of an officer, agent, or employee of, the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or of persons acting pursuant to a contract with such an entity. These exceptions will protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 19&gt;</span><A name="Page19"></A> direction of, a law enforcement or intelligence agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, who are performing lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. These exceptions will also protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, elements or divisions of an agency or department of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, which does not have law enforcement or intelligence as its primary function, but who may nevertheless, in the course of lawfully authorized protective, intelligence, or criminal investigative activities, engage in actions otherwise prohibited by this bill. These exceptions only apply to individuals covered under this section when they are performing investigative, protective, or intelligence activities, within the scope of their duties and in furtherance of lawfully authorized activities.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee is concerned that these sections should not be misinterpreted as an opportunity to circumvent the WIPO Copyright Treaty. It should be clear that this is a routine law enforcement and intelligence exception. As such, the exceptions under sections 1201(f) and 1202(d) are to be narrowly construed. In addition, these exceptions are to be construed in a manner consistent with similar law enforcement and intelligence exceptions found elsewhere in U.S. law, such as 18 U.S.C. 1029(f), 1030(f), or 2512(2)(b).</p>

<h2>Title II</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>Although the copyright infringement liability of on-line and Internet service providers (OSPs and ISPs) is not expressly addressed in the actual provisions of the WIPO treaties, the Committee is sympathetic to the desire of such service providers to see the law clarified in this area. There have been several cases relevant to service provider liability for copyright infringement.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=FNRef>20</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Most have approached the issue from the standpoint of contributory and vicarious liability. Rather than embarking upon a wholesale clarification of these doctrines, the Committee decided to leave current law in its evolving state and, instead, to create a series of “safe harbors,” for certain common activities of service providers. A service provider which qualifies for a safe harbor, receives the benefit of limited liability.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In the beginning, the Committee identified the following activities: (1) digital network communications, (2) system caching, (3) information stored on service providers, and (4) information location tools. In the end, Title II contains five general categories of activities, which are addressed in a newly created section 512 in Chapter 5 of the Copyright Act. This new section contains limitations on service providers’ liability for five general categories of activity set forth in subsections (a) through (d) and subsection (f). As provided in subsection (k), Section 512 is not intended to imply that a service provider is or is not liable as an infringer either for conduct that qualifies for a limitation of liability or for conduct that fails to so qualify. Rather, the limitations of liability apply if the provider is found to be liable under existing principles of law.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 20&gt;</span><A name="Page20"></A> The limitations in subsections (a) through (d) protect qualifying service providers from liability for all monetary relief for direct, vicarious and contributory infringement. Monetary relief is defined in subsection (j)(2) as encompassing damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and any other form of monetary payment. These subsections also limit injunctive relief against qualifying service providers to the extent specified in subsection (I). To qualify for these protections, service providers must meet the conditions set forth in subsection (h), and service providers’ activities at issue must involve a function described in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d) or (f), respectively. The liability limitations apply to networks “operated by or for the service provider,” thereby protecting both service providers who offer a service and subcontractors who may operate parts of, or an entire, system or network for another service provider.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Title II preserves strong incentives for service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect and deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital networked environment. At the same time, it provides greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities.</p>

<h3>Particular concerns of educational institutions</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>At least two concerns have been raised concerning the applicability of section 512 to educational institutions, such as universities and libraries, when they act as on-line service providers. The first concerns the extent to which the knowledge of faculty members using the Internet will be imputed to a college or university as a whole or the specific department within the college or university responsible for providing Internet service. To the extent such knowledge is imputed, the on-line service provider might fail to qualify for certain of the exceptions to liability included in this section. This is one of the specific questions upon which the Copyright Office study authorized in section 204 of this Act will focus. Without prejudging any issues to be considered in that study, it seems that the extent to which knowledge is imputed to the service provider in the case of colleges and universities, and in other settings in which the service provider and end-user share an employee-employer or other relationship, is a matter of the relevant State law of respondeat superior, rather than a matter of Federal copyright law. As a consequence, there may be much that a non-profit educational institution can do to structure the internal relationships between its faculty and its online service provider functions. What is more, nothing in this Act should be read to preclude a Federal court from taking into account the special circumstances of a non-profit educational institution in applying agency law to determine whether knowledge should be imputed to such an institution in its capacity as an online service provider.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second concern raised about the applicability of section 512 to public universities and libraries, and indeed other public entities which operate as online service providers, is that by complying with the notice and take-down provisions of section 512, the public entities might violate the due process rights of their users. Any such due process objection suffers at least two flaws. In the first place, a prerequisite to any due process claim is a state law property <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 21&gt;</span><A name="Page21"></A> interest. In the case of the relatively new concept of Internet access, the service provider contract, rather than any common law property interest, would appear to be the yardstick of the Internet user’s property interest in continued access. The contract for Internet service, therefore, can limit any property interest that would form the basis for a procedural due process claim. Second, and even more important, the procedural protections afforded by the notification requirements of subsection 512(c)(3) and the provisions for the replacement of removed or disabled materials in subsection 512(f) provide all the process that is due. The Committee was acutely concerned that it provide all end-users–whether contracting with private or public sector online service providers–with appropriate procedural protections to ensure that material is not disabled without proper justification. The provisions in the bill balance the need for rapid response to potential infringement with the end-users legitimate interests in not having material removed without recourse.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In order to explore these and other issues more fully, the Committee provides in section 204 for a study to be conducted by the Register of Copyrights.</p>

<h2>Title III</h2>

<h3>Computer maintenance or repair</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Title III of the bill amends section 117 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 117) to ensure that independent service organizations do not inadvertently become liable for copyright infringement merely because they have turned on a machine in order to service its hardware components.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>When a computer is activated, that is when it is turned on, certain software or parts thereof (generally the machine’s operating system software) is automatically copied into the machine’s random access memory, or “RAM”. During the course of activating the computer, different parts of the operating system may reside in the RAM at different times because the operating system is sometimes larger than the capacity of the RAM. Because such copying has been held to constitute a “reproduction” under section 106 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 106),<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=FNRef>21</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>a person who activated the machine without the authorization of the copyright owner of that software could be liable for copyright infringement. This legislation has the narrow and specific intent of relieving independent service providers, persons unaffiliated with either the owner or lessee of the machine, from liability under the Copyright Act when, solely by virtue of activating the machine in which a computer program resides, they inadvertently cause an unauthorized copy of that program to be made.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This title is narrowly crafted to achieve the foregoing objective without prejudicing the rights of copyright owners of computer software. Thus, for example, 1201(k) does not relieve from liability <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 22&gt;</span><A name="Page22"></A> persons who make unauthorized adaptations, modifications, or other changes to the software. This title also does not relieve from liability persons who make any unauthorized copies of software other than those caused solely by activation of the machine.</p>

<h2>Title IV</h2>

<h3>A. Ephemeral Recordings</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 401 of the bill amends section 112 of the Copyright Act to address two issues concerning the application of the ephemeral recording exemption in the digital age.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first of these issues is the relationship between the ephemeral recording exemption and the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 (“DPRA”). The DPRA granted sound recording copyright owners the exclusive right to perform their works publicly by means of digital audio transmission, subject to certain limitations, particularly those set forth in section 114(d). Among those limitations is an exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions, which are defined as those made by terrestrial broadcast stations licensed as such by the FCC. 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(A)(iii) and (j)(2). The ephemeral recording exemption presently privileges certain activities of a transmitting organization when it is entitled to transmit a performance or display under a license or transfer of copyright ownership or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a). The Committee believes that the ephemeral recording exemption should apply to broadcast radio and television stations when they make nonsubscription digital broadcasts permitted by the DPRA. The Committee has therefore changed the existing language of the ephemeral recording exemption (redesignated as 112(a)(1)) to extend explicitly to broadcasters the same privilege they already enjoy with respect to analog broadcasts.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second of these issues is the relationship between the ephemeral recording exemption and the anticircumvention provisions that the bill adds as section 1201 of the Copyright Act. Concerns were expressed that if use of copy protection technologies became widespread, a transmitting organization might be prevented from engaging in its traditional activities of assembling transmission programs and making ephemeral recordings permitted by section 112 for purposes of its own transmissions within its local service area and of archival preservation and security. To address this concern, the Committee has added to section 112 a new paragraph that permits transmitting organizations to engage in activities that otherwise would violate section 1201(a)(1) in certain limited circumstances when necessary for the exercise of the transmitting organization’s privilege to make ephemeral recordings under redesignated section 112(a)(1). By way of example, if a radio station could not make a permitted ephemeral recording from a commercially available phonorecord without violating section 1201(a)(1), then the radio station could request from the copyright owner the necessary means of making a permitted ephemeral recording. If the copyright owner did not then either provide a phonorecord that could be reproduced or otherwise provide the necessary means of making a permitted ephemeral recording from the phonorecord already in the possession of the radio station, the radio station would not be liable for violating section 1201(a)(1) for taking the steps <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 23&gt;</span><A name="Page23"></A> necessary for engaging in activities permitted under section 112(a)(1). The radio station would, of course, be liable for violating section 1201(a)(1) if it engaged in activities prohibited by that section in other than the limited circumstances permitted by section 112(a)(1).</p>

<h3>B. Distance Education</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>New technology, especially digital technology, is increasingly being used by educational institutions in their distance learning programs. In the past, distance learning programs were developed primarily for students who, because of their special circumstances, could not be taught in a traditional classroom. Section 110(2) of the copyright law contains an exemption that accommodates this type of activity. The current exemption is designed to cover instructional broadcasting, and allows the use of only certain categories of works. Future distance education, however, may involve a wider range of activities, including the use of interactive digital transmissions, and be designed for a broader audience of students working from personal computers in their own homes.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee believes that the scope of the distance education exemption should be re-examined in light of the range of educational activities made possible by digital technologies. The Committee therefore initiated discussions on distance learning with representatives of libraries, educational institutions and copyright owners, and asked the Register of Copyrights to recommend any appropriate legislative language for an updated distance education exemption. In response to this request by Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy and Senator Ashcroft, the Register reported the conclusion that digital distance education is an evolving field, and the range of activities contemplated is diverse and potentially far-reaching in impact and scope.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In light of the complexity, importance and potential scope of the issues implicated by distance education, the Committee has determined that further study of the issues would be useful. The Committee therefore has directed the Copyright Office to provide Congress with a report recommending ways to promote distance learning through digital technologies no later than six months after enactment of this legislation. In conducting this study, the Copyright Office is required to consult with representatives of copyright owners, nonprofit educational institutions, libraries and archives. The Committee anticipates that the Copyright Office will also consult with others with relevant expertise, where appropriate, such as the Department of Education.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee underscores the importance to the public of a speedy resolution of any copyright issues associated with distance learning and commits itself to developing a fair and effective distance learning regime promptly after receipt of the Register’s Report.</p>

<h4>Fair use</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>The bill does not amend section 107 of the Copyright Act, the fair use provision. The Committee determined that no change to section 107 was required because section 107, as written, is technologically <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 24&gt;</span><A name="Page24"></A> neutral, and therefore, the fair use doctrine is fully applicable in the digital world as in the analog world.</p>

<h3>C. Exemption For Libraries And Archives</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 108 of title 17 permits libraries and archives of the type described in that section to make and, in some cases, distribute a limited number of copies of certain types of copyrighted works, without the permission of the copyright holder, for specified purposes relating to these entities’ functions as repositories of such works for public reference. Section 403 of the bill updates section 108 to allow these entities to take advantage of digital technologies when engaging in specified preservation activities.</p>

<h1>V. Section-by-Section Analysis</h1>

<h3>Section 1. Short title</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This Act may be cited as the “Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.’</p>

<h3>Section 2. Table of contents</h3>

<h2>Title I–WIPO Treaties Implementation</h2>

<h3>Section 101. Short title</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This Title may be cited as the “WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act of 1998.”</p>

<h3>Section 102. Technical amendments</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>To comply with the obligations of the WIPO Treaties, several technical amendments to the U.S. Copyright Act are necessary. These amendments are needed to ensure that works from countries that join the two new WIPO Treaties, including works in existence on the date each treaty becomes effective for the United States, will be protected in the United States on a formality-free basis, as required by the provisions of each treaty. Three sections of the Copyright Act require amendment: (1) section 104, which specifies the conditions on which works from other countries are protected in the United States; (2) section 104A, which restores protection to certain preexisting works from other countries that have fallen into the public domain in the United States; and (3) section 411(a), which makes copyright registration a precondition to bringing suit for infringement for some works. In addition, the amendments made to <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 26&gt;</span><A name="Page26"></A> these sections require some additions to, and changes in, the definition section of the Copyright Act, section 101.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–Amendments to Section 101: Definitions.</span></span>&nbsp;–The bill amends section 101 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 101) to define “treaty party” as “any country or intergovernmental organization that is a party to an international agreement” and to define “international agreement” to include, inter alia, the two new WIPO Treaties. Definitions of the two new WIPO Treaties are also provided. In addition, a definition of “United States work” was added for purposes of section 411 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 411), as amended by the bill.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)–Amendments to Section 104: Subject Matter of Copyright: National Origin.</span></span>&nbsp;–Section 104 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 104) identifies the criteria that must be met for a work to qualify for protection under the U.S. copyright law (i.e., “points of attachment’). Among those protected under section 104 are nationals or domiciliaries of those countries with which we have an appropriate treaty relationship. Section 104, as it is presently written, explicitly identifies those treaty relationships, but does not refer to the two new WIPO Treaties. Therefore, section 104 needs to be amended to provide for points of attachment for the two new WIPO Treaties.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (b) amends section 104 so that all countries that have copyright relations with the United States would be referred to collectively by the term “treaty parties.” This change, in conjunction with the amendments to section 101, which define “treaty party” and “international agreement,” serves to ensure that the two new WIPO Treaties are covered by section 104. This subsection also amends section 104 to extend protection to foreign works from any treaty party based on four points of attachment: nationality of the author, place of first publication of the work, place of fixation of the sounds embodied in a sound recording, and the situs of a constructed architectural work.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The way section 104 is presently written requires that it be amended each time U.S. treaty membership changes. By defining “treaty party” in section 101 and amending section 104 to refer to “treaty party,” future changes in the treaties to which the U.S. is a party would not require changes to section 104. It is much clearer and less unwieldy to have a single set of criteria for eligibility in section 104 as proposed by this bill, rather than multiple, overlapping criteria in a long list of complex definitions in section 101. If the U.S. joins any future treaties, those treaties can simply be added to the list of “international agreements” without any detailed amendments repeating the criteria for eligibility. The amendment to section 104 also makes clear that membership in the Geneva Phonograms Convention and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty provides national eligibility for sound recordings only, not other types of works.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Amendments to Section 104A: Copyright in Restored Works.</span></span>&nbsp;–Subsection (c) amends section 104A(h) of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 104A(h)) by adding the two new WIPO Treaties to the definitions of “date of adherence or proclamation” and “eligible country.” It would also add a paragraph to the definition of “restored work” to ensure that copyrighted works other than <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 27&gt;</span><A name="Page27"></A> sound recordings do not qualify as restored works where the sole basis for protection in the United States is adherence to the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (d)–Amendments to Section 411(a): Registration and Infringement Actions.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>In its current form, section 411(a) of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 411(a)) requires works to be registered with the Copyright Office before suit can be brought for their infringement, but exempts Berne Convention works whose country of origin is not the United States. Subsection (d) amends section 411(a) of the Copyright Act to include works from members of the two new WIPO Treaties within the exemption.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The amendments made by subsection (d) reframe the registration requirement in the affirmative–essentially the converse of the current section 411(a). In other words, the provision would state affirmatively that “United States works” must be registered before suit. Rather than frame an exemption from that requirement for certain works whose origin is not the United   States, section 411(a) would, as amended by this subsection, merely limit the requirement of registration as a precondition to suit to those works whose country of origin is the United States. “United States works” are defined in section 101 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 101), as amended by this Title. As discussed with respect to the amendments in subsection (b) to section 104 of the Copyright Act, section 411(a), as amended by this subsection, may be easily updated each time the United States joins another treaty, without the need to change several interrelated provisions of the Act.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (e)–Amendment to section 507(a).</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Section 507(a) of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 507(a)) provides for a 3-year statute of limitations period for all criminal copyright actions. Subsection (e) amends section 507(a) to recognize exceptions to the 3-year limitations period if expressly provided elsewhere in title 17. This amendment is necessary in light of the 5-year criminal limitation period contained in the new chapter 12 of title 17, which is created by this title.</p>

<h3>Section 103. Copyright protection systems and copyright management information</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>The two new WIPO Treaties include substantively identical provisions on technological measures of protection (also commonly referred to as the “black box” or “anticircumvention” provisions). These provisions require contracting parties to provide “adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Both of the new WIPO treaties also include substantively identical provisions requiring contracting parties to protect the integrity of copyright management information. The treaties define copyright management information as “information which identifies the work, the author of the work, the owner of any right in the work, or information about the terms and conditions of use of the work, and any numbers or codes that represent such information, <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 28&gt;</span><A name="Page28"></A> when any of these items of information is attached to a copy of a work or appears in connection with the communication of a work to the public.’</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Legislation is required to comply with both of these provisions. To accomplish this, the bill adds a new chapter (chapter twelve) to title 17 of the United States Code. This new chapter twelve includes five sections–(1) section 1201, which prohibits the circumvention of technological copyright protection measures; (2) section 1202, which protects the integrity of copyright management information; (3) section 1203, which provides for civil remedies for violations of sections 1201 and 1202; (4) section 1204, which provides for criminal penalties for violations of sections 1201 and 1202; and (5) section 1205, which provides a savings clause to preserve the effectiveness of federal and state laws in protecting individual privacy on the Internet.</p>

<h4>Section 1201. Circumvention of copyright protection systems</h4>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–Violations regarding circumvention of technological protection measures.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (a) applies when a person has not obtained authorized access to a copy or a phonorecord of a work that is protected under the Copyright Act and for which the copyright owner has put in place a technological measure that effectively controls access to his or her work. The relevant terminology is defined in paragraph (a)(3), as described below.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (a)(1) establishes a general prohibition against gaining unauthorized access to a work by circumventing a technological protection measure put in place by the copyright owner where such protection measure otherwise effectively controls access to a work protected under title 17 of the U.S. Code. This paragraph does not apply to the subsequent actions of a person once he or she has obtained authorized access to a copy of a work protected under title 17, even if such actions involve circumvention of other types of technological protection measures.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In order to provide meaningful protection and enforcement of the copyright owner’s right to control access to his or her copyrighted work, paragraph (a)(2) supplements the prohibition against the act of circumvention in paragraph (a)(1) with prohibitions on creating and making available certain technologies, products and services used, developed or advertised to defeat technological protections against unauthorized access to a work. Similar laws have been enacted in related contexts. See, e.g. , 17 U.S.C. 1002(a) (prohibiting the import, manufacture, or distribution of digital audio recording equipment lacking specified characteristics and prohibiting the import, manufacture, or distribution of any device, or the offer to perform any service, the primary purpose or effect of which is to circumvent the serial copy management system required for digital audio equipment); 47 U.S.C. 553(a)(2) (prohibiting the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended for the unauthorized reception of cable television service); 47 U.S.C. 605(e)(4) (prohibiting the manufacture, assembly, import, and sale of equipment used in the unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming.)</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Specifically, paragraph (a)(2) prohibits manufacturing, importing, offering to the public, providing, or otherwise trafficking in certain technologies, products, services, devices, components, or parts <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 29&gt;</span><A name="Page29"></A> that can be used to circumvent a technological protection measure that otherwise effectively controls access to a work protected under title 17. It is drafted carefully to target “black boxes,” and to ensure that legitimate multipurpose devices can continue to be made and sold. For a technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof to be prohibited under this subsection, one of three conditions must be met. It must: (1) be primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing; (2) have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent; or (3) be marketed by the person who manufactures it, imports it, offers it to the public, provides it or otherwise traffics in it, or by another person acting in concert with that person with that person’s knowledge, for use in circumventing a technological protection measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under title 17. This provision is designed to protect copyright owners, and simultaneously allow the development of technology.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (a)(3) defines certain terms used throughout paragraph (a). Subparagraph (1) defines the term “circumvent a technological protection measure” as meaning “to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological protection measure, without the authority of the copyright owner.” This definition applies to paragraph (a) only, which covers protections against unauthorized initial access to a copyrighted work. Subparagraph (2) states that a technological protection measure “effectively controls access to a work” if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)–Additional violations.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (b) applies to those technological measures employed by a copyright owner that effectively protect his or her copyright rights in a work, as opposed to those technological protection measures covered by subsection (a), which prevent unauthorized access to a copyrighted work. Unlike subsection (a), which prohibits the circumvention of access control technologies, subsection (b) does not, by itself, prohibit the circumvention of effective technological copyright protection measures. It is anticipated that most acts of circumventing a technological copyright protection measure will occur in the course of conduct which itself implicates the copyright owners rights under title 17. This subsection is not intended in any way to enlarge or diminish those rights. Thus, for example, where a copy control technology is employed to prevent the unauthorized reproduction of a work, the circumvention of that technology would not itself be actionable under section 1201, but any reproduction of the work that is thereby facilitated would remain subject to the protections embodied in title 17.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paralleling paragraph (a)(2), above, paragraph (b)(1) seeks to provide meaningful protection and enforcement of copyright owners’ use of technological protection measures to protect their rights under title 17 by prohibiting the act of making or selling the technological means to overcome these protections and thereby facilitate copyright infringement. Paragraph (b)(1) prohibits manufacturing, importing, offering to the public, providing, or otherwise <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 30&gt;</span><A name="Page30"></A> trafficking in certain technologies, products, services, devices, components, or parts thereof that can be used to circumvent a technological protection measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under title 17 in a work or portion thereof. Again, for a technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof to be prohibited under this subsection, one of three conditions must be met. It must: (1) be primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing; (2) have only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent; or (3) be marketed by the person who manufactures it, imports it, offers it to the public, provides it, or otherwise traffics in it, or by another person acting in concert with that person with that person’s knowledge, for use in circumventing a technological protection measure that effectively protects the right of a copyright owner under title 17 in a work or a portion thereof. Like paragraph (a)(2), this provision is designed to protect copyright owners, and simultaneously allow the development of technology.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (b)(2) defines certain terms used in subsection (b). Subparagraph (b)(2)(A) defines the term “circumvent protection afforded by a technological protection measure” as “avoiding, bypassing, removing, deactivating, or otherwise impairing a technological protection measure.” Subparagraph (b)(2)(B) provides that a technological protection measure “effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under title 17” if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits the exercise of a right under Title 17 of a copyright owner.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Importation.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (c) prohibits the importation, sale for importation, or sale within the United States after importation by the owner, importer or consignee of any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof covered by subsections (a) or (b). This paragraph further provides that violations of this provision are actionable under section 337 of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1337), which authorizes actions by the International Trade Commission against unfair import practices.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (d)–Other rights, etc., not affected.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (d) sets forth several provisions clarifying the scope of section 1201. Paragraph (d)(1) provides that section 1201 shall not have any effect on rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under title 17. Paragraph (d)(2) provides that section 1201 shall not alter the existing doctrines of contributory or vicarious liability for copyright infringement in connection with any technology, product, service, device, component or part thereof. Together, these provisions are intended to ensure that none of the provisions in section 1201 affect the existing legal regime established in the Copyright Act and case law interpreting that statute.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (d)(3) clarifies that nothing in section 1201 creates a mandate requiring manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computing products to design their products or their parts and components to respond to any particular technological measure employed to protect a copyrighted work. The provision also makes clear, however, that while the failure of a product to respond <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 31&gt;</span><A name="Page31"></A> to a particular technological measure does not in and of itself create liability, neither does the failure of the product to respond to a particular technological protection measure immunize those trafficking in the product from liability under section 1201(a)(2) or (b), if the tests of liability in those provisions are met. </p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (e)–Exemption for nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (e) provides a limited exemption from the prohibition on circumvention of technological protection measures contained in section 1201(a)(1) for qualified nonprofit libraries, archives, and educational institutions.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (1) of this subsection allows a nonprofit library, nonprofit archives or nonprofit educational institution to obtain access to a copyrighted work for the sole purpose of making a good faith determination as to whether it wishes to acquire a copy, or portion of a copy, of that work in order to engage in conduct permitted under the Copyright Act, such as a fair use under section 107. A qualifying institution may not gain access for a period of time longer than necessary to determine whether it wishes to obtain a copy, or portion of a copy, for such purposes, and the right to gain access shall not apply for any other purpose.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2) provides that the right to obtain access under this paragraph only applies when the nonprofit library, nonprofit archives, or nonprofit educational institution cannot obtain a copy of an identical work by other means, and such an entity may not use the exemption in this paragraph for commercial advantage or financial gain without penalty.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (3) seeks to protect the legitimate interests of copyright owners by providing a civil remedy against a library, archive, or educational institution that violates section 1201(a) by gaining access to a commercially exploited copyrighted work and willfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage or financial gain failing to comply with the provisions of paragraph (1)(A) (requiring that a qualifying library, archive, or educational institution not retain the work for longer than necessary to make a good faith determination as to whether to acquire a copy or portion of the work) or paragraph (1)(B) (requiring that a qualifying library, archive, or educational institution not use the work to which it has gained access for any purpose other than to make a good faith determination as to whether to acquire a copy or portion of the work). Under this paragraph, a violator shall be subject to civil remedies under section 1203 for the first time it gains access in violation of section 1201(a) without complying with the requirements of paragraph (1). For subsequent offenses, the violator shall not only be subject to civil remedies under section 1203, but also lose the benefit of the exemption provided by this subsection.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (4) provides that this subsection may not be used as a defense to the prohibitions on manufacturing or selling devices contained in sections 1201(a)(2) or 1202(b).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Finally, paragraph (5) provides that a library or archive, to be eligible for the exemption in paragraph (1), must maintain its collections open to the public and available, not only to researchers affiliated with the library or archives or with the institution of which it is a part, but also to other persons doing research in a specialized field.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (f)–Law enforcement and intelligence activities.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (f) creates an exception for the lawfully authorized investigative, <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 32&gt;</span><A name="Page32"></A> protective, or intelligence activities of an officer, agent, or employee of, the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or of persons acting pursuant to a contract with such an entity. This exception will protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, a law enforcement or intelligence agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, who are performing lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. This exception will also protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, elements or divisions of an agency or department of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, which does not have law enforcement or intelligence as its primary function, but who may nevertheless, in the course of lawfully authorized protective, intelligence, or criminal investigative activities, engage in actions otherwise prohibited by this bill. This exception only applies to individuals covered under this section when they are performing investigative, protective, or intelligence activities, within the scope of their duties and in furtherance of lawfully authorized activities.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsections (g)-(j)–Interoperability of computer programs.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsections (g) through (j) are intended to allow legitimate software developers to continue engaging in certain activities for the purpose of achieving interoperability to the extent permitted by law prior to the enactment of this chapter. The objective is to ensure that the effect of current case law interpreting the Copyright Act is not changed by enactment of this legislation for certain acts of identification and analysis done in respect of computer programs. See, <i>Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc. </i>, 977 F.2d 1510, 24 U.S.P.Q.2d 1561 (9th Cir. 1992.). The purpose of this section is to foster competition and innovation in the computer and software industry.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (g) permits the circumvention of access control technologies for the sole purpose of achieving software interoperability. For example, this subsection permits a software developer to circumvent an access control technology applied to a portion or portions of a program in order to perform the necessary steps to identify and analyze the information necessary to achieve interoperability. Subsection (g) permits the act of circumvention in only certain instances. First, the copy of the computer program which is the subject of the analysis must be lawfully acquired. That is the computer program must be acquired from a legitimate source, along with any necessary serial codes, passwords, or other such means as may be necessary to be able to use the program as it was designed to be used by a consumer of the product. The permitted acts must be limited to those elements of the program which must be analyzed to achieve the sole permitted purpose, which is interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. Interoperability is defined in subsection (j) as the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and for such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged. The resulting product must be a new and original work, in that it may not infringe the original computer program. In addition, the objective of the analysis must be to identify and extract such elements as are necessary to achieve interoperability which are not <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 33&gt;</span><A name="Page33"></A> otherwise available to the person. Finally, the goal of this section is to ensure that current law is not changed, and not to encourage or permit infringement. Thus, each of the acts undertaken must avoid infringing the copyright of the author of the underlying computer program.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (h) recognizes that to accomplish the acts permitted under subsection (g) a person may, in some instances, have to make and use certain tools. In most instances these will be generally available tools that programmers use in developing computer programs, such as compilers, trace analyzers and disassemblers, which are not prohibited by this section. In certain instances, it is possible that a person may have to develop special tools to achieve the permitted purpose of interoperability. Thus, this provision creates an exception to the prohibition on making circumvention tools contained in subsections 1201(a)(2) and (b). These tools can be either software or hardware. Again, this provision is limited by a general admonition not to act in a way that constitutes infringing activity.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (i) recognizes that developing complex computer programs often involves the efforts of many persons. For example, some of these persons may be hired to develop a specific portion of the final product. For that person to perform these tasks, some of the information acquired through the permitted analysis, and the tools to accomplish it, may have to be made available to that person. This subsection allows developers of independently created software to rely on third parties either to develop the necessary circumvention tools or to identify the necessary information to achieve interoperability. The ability to rely on third parties is particularly important for small software developers who do not have the capability of performing these functions in-house. This provision permits such sharing of information and tools. Recognizing, however, that making such circumvention information or tools generally available would undermine the objectives of this Act, this section imposes strict limitations. Such acts of sharing information and tools is permitted solely for the purpose of achieving interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs. If a person makes this information available for a purpose other than to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, that action is a violation of this Act. In addition, these acts are permitted only to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title, or violate applicable law other than this title.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (j) defines “interoperability” as the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and for such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged. The seamless exchange of information is an key element of creating such an interoperable independently created program. This provision applies to computer programs as such, regardless of their medium of fixation and not to works generally, such as music or audiovisual works, which may be fixed and distributed in digital form. Accordingly, since the goal of interoperability is the touchstone of the exceptions contained in subsections 1201(g) through (j), nothing in those subsections can be read to authorize the circumvention of any technological protection measure that controls access to any work other <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 34&gt;</span><A name="Page34"></A> than a computer program, or the trafficking in products or services for that purpose.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (k).</span></span> <i>–</i>The Committee was concerned that section 1201(a) might inadvertently make it unlawful for parents to protect their children from pornography and other harmful material available on the Internet, or have unintended legal consequences for manufacturers of products designed solely to enable parents to protect their children in this fashion. Subsection (k) addresses these concerns.</p>

<h4>Section 1202: Integrity of copyright management information</h4>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 1202 implements the obligation contained in Article 12 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and Article 19 of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty that Contracting Parties “provide adequate and effective legal remedies” against any person who knowingly and without authority removes or alters copyright management information (CMI), or who distributes, imports, broadcasts, or communicates to the public, works or copies of works knowing that such information has been removed or altered without authority.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=FNRef>22</span></a> This section does not mandate the use of CMI, nor does it prescribe the choice of any particular type of CMI for those who do use it. It merely protects the integrity of CMI if a party chooses to use it in connection with a copyrighted work by prohibiting its deliberate deletion or alteration. Furthermore, this section imposes liability for specified acts. It does not address the question of liability for persons who manufacture devices or provide services.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–False copyright management information.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (a) establishes a general prohibition against intentionally providing false copyright management information, as defined in subsection (c), and against distributing or importing for distribution false copyright management information. There are two prerequisites that must be met for these prohibitions to be violated: <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 35&gt;</span><A name="Page35"></A> (1) the person providing, distributing or importing the false CMI must know the CMI is false, and (2) the person providing, distributing, or importing the false CMI must do so with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of any right under title 17.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)–Removal or alteration of copyright management information.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (b) establishes general prohibitions against removing or altering CMI, against distributing or importing for distribution altered CMI, and against distributing, importing for distribution or publicly performing works in which CMI has been removed. There are three specific acts prohibited if they are committed without the authority of the copyright owner or the law, and if they are done knowing, or with respect to civil remedies under section 1203, having reasonable grounds to know, that they will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal a copyright infringement: (1) intentionally removing or altering CMI; (2) distributing or importing for distribution CMI knowing that it has been altered without the authority of the copyright owner or the law; or (3) distributing, importing for distribution, or publicly performing works, copies of works, or phonorecords knowing that CMI has been removed or altered without the authority of the copyright owner or the law.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Definition.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (c) defines “copyright management information.” To fall within the definition, there is a threshold requirement that the information be conveyed in connection with copies or phonorecords, performances or displays of the copyrighted work. The term “conveyed” is used in its broadest sense and is not meant to require any type of transfer, physical or otherwise, of the information. It merely requires that the information be accessible in conjunction with, or appear with, the work being accessed. Such information is “copyright management information” as defined in this subsection if it falls within the categories enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (1) describes information that identifies the copyrighted work, including the title of a work. This paragraph makes clear that the information set forth on a notice of copyright is included within the definition of copyright management information.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2) describes information that identifies the author of the work. Paragraph (3) describes information that identifies the copyright owner.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (4) describes information that identifies a performer whose performance is fixed in a work, other than an audiovisual work. Information that identifies such a performer is excluded from the definition of CMI, however, when such information is conveyed by a radio or television broadcast station in connection with the public performance of a work.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (5) describes, in the case of an audiovisual work, information that identifies the writer, performer, or director who is credited in the work. Paralleling paragraph (4), information that identifies such a writer, performer, or director is excluded from the definition of CMI when such information is conveyed by a radio or television broadcast station in connection with the public performance of a work.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 36&gt;</span><A name="Page36"></A> Paragraph (6) describes numbers and symbols which refer to or represent the above information. As noted above, both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty require that numbers and symbols be included within the definition of CMI. Links, such as embedded pointers and hypertext links, to the above information are also included. The phrase “links to such information” was included because removing or altering a link to the information will have the same adverse effect as removing or altering the information itself.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Finally, paragraph (7) permits the Register of Copyrights to prescribe by regulation other information that, if conveyed in connection with a work, is to be protected as copyright management information. To protect the privacy of users of copyrighted works, however, the Register of Copyrights may not include within the definition of CMI any information concerning users of copyrighted works.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Consistent with the proviso contained in paragraph (7), it should be noted that the definition of “copyright management information” does not encompass, nor is it intended to encompass, tracking or usage information relating to the identity of users of the works. The definition of CMI is limited by this subsection to the types of information listed, and it would be inconsistent with the purpose and construction of this bill, and contrary to the protection of privacy to include, tracking and usage information within the definition of CMI.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (d)–Law enforcement and intelligence activities.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Section 1202(d) creates an exception for the lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities of an officer, agent, or employee of, the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or of persons acting pursuant to a contract with such an entity. This exception will protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, a law enforcement or intelligence agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, who are performing lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. This exception will also protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, elements or divisions of an agency or department of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, which does not have law enforcement or intelligence as its primary function, but who may nevertheless, in the course of lawfully authorized protective, intelligence, or criminal investigative activities, engage in actions otherwise prohibited by this section. This exception only applies to individuals covered under this subsection when they are performing investigative, protective, or intelligence activities, within the scope of their duties and in furtherance of lawfully authorized activities.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (e)–Limitations on Liability.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (e) recognizes special problems that certain broadcasting entities may have with the transmission of copyright management information. Under this subsection, radio and television broadcasters, cable systems, and persons who provide programming to such broadcasters or systems, who do not intend to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal infringement (eligible persons) may be eligible for a limitation on liability for violation of the copyright management information provisions of subsection (b) in certain, limited circumstances.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 37&gt;</span><A name="Page37"></A> In the case of an analog transmission, paragraph (1) provides that an eligible person will not be held liable for violating provisions of subsection (b) if it is not “technically feasible” for that person to avoid the violation or if avoiding the violation would “create an undue financial hardship.” Avoiding a violation of subsection (b) with respect to the transmission of credits that are of an excessive duration in relation to standard practice in the relevant industries (for instance, the motion picture and television broadcast industries) is one example of an activity that may “create an undue financial hardship” under paragraph (1). As indicated above, this limitation on liability applies only if such person did not intend, by engaging in such activity, to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2) provides a limitation on liability in the case of a digital transmission, and contemplates voluntary digital transmission standards for the placement of copyright management information. Separate standards are likely to be set for the location of copyright management information in different categories of works. For instance, the standard(s) for the location of the name of the copyright owner in a sound recording or musical work to be broadcast by radio stations may differ–and be set in a separate standard-setting process(es)–from the standard for the location of such information in a motion picture to be broadcast by television stations.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2)(A) provides that if a digital transmission standard for the placement of copyright management information for a category of works is set in a voluntary, consensus standard-setting process involving a representative cross-section of the relevant copyright owners and relevant transmitting industry, including but not limited to representatives of radio or television broadcast stations, cable systems, and copyright owners of a category of works that are intended for public performance by such stations or systems, an eligible person will not be liable for a violation of subsection (b) if the copyright management information involved in the violation was not placed in a location specified by the standard for that information. The eligible person, however, cannot qualify for this limitation on liability if that person was responsible for the nonconforming placement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2)(B)(i) provides that until such a standard is set for a category of works, an eligible person will not be liable for a violation of subsection (b) if the transmission of the copyright management information would cause a perceptible visual or aural degradation of the digital signal. Paragraph (2)(B)(ii) provides that during this time period before a standard is set, an eligible person also will not be liable if the digital transmission of the information would conflict with an applicable government regulation or industry standard relating to transmission of information in a digital signal, such as the regulation requiring the placement of closed captioning in line 21 of the vertical blanking interval (47 C.F.R. 79.1, implementing 47 U.S.C. 613). For purposes of this paragraph, however, the applicable industry-wide standard must be of a type specified in paragraphs (2)(B)(ii)(II) or (III). The first type, defined in paragraph (2)(B)(ii)(II), includes only those standards that were adopted by a voluntary, consensus standards body, such as the Advanced <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 38&gt;</span><A name="Page38"></A> Television Systems Committee, before the effective date of section 1202. The other type, defined in paragraph (2)(B)(ii)(III), includes only those standards adopted in a voluntary, consensus standards-setting process open to participation by groups, including but not limited to a representative cross-section of radio or television broadcast stations, cable systems, and copyright owners of a category of works that are intended for public performance by such stations or systems.</p>

<h4>Section 1203–Civil remedies</h4>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–Civil actions.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (a) sets forth the general proposition that civil remedies are available for violations of sections 1201 and 1202. This paragraph establishes the jurisdiction for such civil actions as the “appropriate U.S. district court” and limits standing to bring a civil action to those persons injured by a violation of section 1201 or 1202.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)–Powers of the court</span></span><i>.&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (b) sets out the powers of the court that hears the case. Paragraph (1) authorizes the court to grant temporary and permanent injunctions on such terms as it deems reasonable to prevent or restrain a violation of section 1201 or 1202. Paragraph (2) authorizes the court to order the impounding of any device or product that is in the custody or control of the alleged violator and that the court has reasonable cause to believe was involved in a violation. Under paragraph (3), the court may award damages as provided in subsection (c). Paragraph (4) authorizes the court to allow the recovery of costs by or against any party other than the United States or an officer thereof. Under paragraph (5), the court may award reasonable attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. Finally, paragraph (6) authorizes the court to order the remedial modification or the destruction of any device or product involved in a violation of section 1201 or 1202 that is in the custody or control of the violator or has been impounded under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Award of damages.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (c) is divided into five paragraphs, each of which addresses the awarding of damages to the prevailing party.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (1) establishes the general proposition that a person who violates section 1201 or 1202 is liable for either actual damages and any additional profits of the violator, or statutory damages.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraphs (2) and (3) specify that the complaining party may finalize a choice between the two types of damage awards at any time until the final judgment is entered.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2) provides that, when the prevailing party opts for actual damages, the court shall award to that party the actual damages suffered by the party as a result of the violations, as well as any profits of the violator that are attributable to the violation and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (3) provides different statutory award amounts depending upon whether the civil action involves a section 1201 or 1202 violation. When the violation is a section 1201 violation and the prevailing party opts to recover an award of statutory damages, the prevailing party will be awarded statutory damages of not less than $200 or more than $2,500 per act of circumvention, device, <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 39&gt;</span><A name="Page39"></A> product, component, offer, or performance of service. When the violation is a section 1202 violation and the prevailing party opts to recover an award of statutory damages, the prevailing party will be awarded statutory damages of not less than $2,500 or more than $25,000 for each violation.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraphs (4) and (5) set forth circumstances in which it would be appropriate to increase or decrease a damage award.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (4) provides for an increased damage award when the violator is a repeat offender. Specifically, when the prevailing party establishes that a person violated section 1201 or 1202 within three years after a final judgment was entered against that person for another such violation, the award of damages may be increased to a sum of up to triple the amount that would otherwise be awarded.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (5)(A) provides that, when a violator of section 1201 or 1202 was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation, the damage award may be reduced or remitted. Paragraph (5)(B) requires the reduction or remission of damages in certain circumstances by providing that, when a nonprofit library, nonprofit archives, or nonprofit educational institution violator of section 1201 or 1202 was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation, the damage award shall be remitted entirely.</p>

<h4>Section 1204–Criminal offenses and penalties</h4>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–In general.</span></span>&nbsp;–Subsection (a) provides for the availability of criminal penalties for violations of sections 1201 and 1202. The standard applicable under this subsection is identical to the standard used in section 506 of the Copyright Act to establish criminal violations. Subsection (a)(1) sets forth the penalties available for a criminal violation of sections 1201 and 1202 as “not more than $500,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both” for the first offense. If the person who is found guilty of criminal violation of sections 1201 or 1202 is a repeat offender, subsection (a)(2) provides that penalties may be increased to “not more than $1,000,000 or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)–Limitation for nonprofit library, archives, or educational institution.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (b) exempts completely any nonprofit library, nonprofit archives or nonprofit educational institution from the criminal penalties contained in subsection (a).</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Statute of limitations.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (c) provides for a 5-year statute of limitations for criminal offenses under chapter 12.</p>

<h3>Section 104. Conforming amendment</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This section amends the table of chapters for title 17 to reflect the addition of new chapter 12.</p>

<h3>Section 105. Effective date</h3>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–In general.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (a) establishes the effective date of the proposed amendments in this bill as the date the bill is enacted into law, subject to the exceptions enumerated in subsection (b). </p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 40&gt;</span><A name="Page40"></A> <span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)</span></span><i>–</i>Amendments relating to certain international agreements.&nbsp;–Subsection (b) sets forth several exceptions to the effective date established by subsection (a). These exceptions only apply to the technical amendments that are proposed in section 102 of the bill. Section 105 of the bill changes the effective date of any provision in section 102 of the bill that specifically refers to the WIPO Copyright Treaty or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty from the date the bill is enacted into law to the date the Treaty enters into force.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>These exceptions are necessary because, as of the drafting of this bill, the two treaties have not entered into force and will not do so until three months after 30 States deposit their instruments of ratification or accession with the Director General of WIPO. The exceptions ensure that the amendments that refer specifically to the two treaties do not become effective until the treaties themselves become effective. In addition, it was necessary to refer to each treaty separately in this section, because it is possible that the two treaties may enter into force at different times and the amendments particular to each treaty had to be grouped together to ensure that the provisions relating specifically to one treaty do not become effective once the other treaty enters into force. Finally, it was necessary to add the phrase “with respect to the United States” in paragraphs (1) and (2) to ensure that, if the Treaties enter into force before the United States deposits its instrument of accession, the United States does not extend benefits to Member States of these Treaties until the United States becomes party to the Treaties.</p>

<h2>Title II–Internet Copyright Infringement Liability</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The liability of online service providers and Internet access providers for copyright infringements that take place in the online environment has been a controversial issue. Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Internet Copyright Infringement Liability Clarification Act, addresses this complex issue. Title II preserves strong incentives for service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect and deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital networked environment. At the same time, it provides greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>New section 512 contains limitations on service providers’ liability for five general categories of activity set forth in subsections (a) through (d) and subsection (f). As provided in subsection (k), section 512 is not intended to imply that a service provider is or is not liable as an infringer either for conduct that qualifies for a limitation of liability or for conduct that fails to so qualify. Rather, the limitations of liability apply if the provider is found to be liable under existing principles of law.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The limitations in subsections (a) through (d) protect qualifying service providers from liability for all monetary relief for direct, vicarious and contributory infringement. Monetary relief is defined in subsection (j)(2) as encompassing damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and any other form of monetary payment. These subsections also limit injunctive relief against qualifying service providers to the extent <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 41&gt;</span><A name="Page41"></A> specified in subsection (i). To qualify for these protections, service providers must meet the conditions set forth in subsection (h), and service providers’ activities at issue must involve a function described in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d) or (f), respectively. The liability limitations apply to networks “operated by or for the service provider,” thereby protecting both service providers who offer a service and subcontractors who may operate parts of, or an entire, system or network for another service provider.</p>

<h3>Section 201. Short title</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This title may be cited as the “Internet Copyright Infringement Liability Clarification Act of 1998.”</p>

<h3>Section 202. Limitations on liability for Internet copyright infringement</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This section amends chapter 5 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 501, et. seq. ) to create a new section 512, titled “Liability of service providers for online infringement of copyright.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (a)–Digital network communications.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (a) applies to communications functions associated with sending digital communications of others across digital networks, such as the Internet and other online networks. It establishes a limitation on liability for infringements that may occur in the provision of services falling within the definition of subsection (j)(1)(A). The limitations on injunctive relief set forth in subsection (i)(1)(B) are applicable when the functions at issue fall within the provisions of subsection (a), and the service provider meets the threshold criteria of subsection (h).<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=FNRef>23</span></a> Subsection (a) applies to service providers transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material, and some forms of intermediate and transient storage of material in the course of performing these functions. For example, in the course of moving packets of information across digital online networks, many intermediate and transient copies of the information may be made in routers and servers along the way. Such copies are created as an automatic consequence of the transmission process. In this context, “intermediate and transient” refers to such a copy made and/or stored in the course of a transmission, not a copy made or stored at the points where the transmission is initiated or received.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The use of the term “transmitting” throughout section 512 is not intended to be limited to transmissions of “a performance or display” of “images or sounds” within the meaning of section 101 of the Copyright Act.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsections (a)(1) through (5) limit the range of activities that qualify under this subsection to ones in which a service provider plays the role of a “conduit” for the communications of others. This limitation on liability applies if: (1) the communication was initiated by or at the direction of a person other than the service provider; (2) it is carried out through an automatic technical process without selection of the material by the service provider; (3) the service provider does not select the recipients of the material except as an automatic response to the request of another; (4) no copy<span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 42&gt;</span><A name="Page42"></A> of the material made in the course of intermediate or transient storage is maintained on the system or network so that it is ordinarily accessible to other than the anticipated recipients, and no copy is maintained on the system or network in a manner ordinarily accessible to the anticipated recipients for a longer period than is reasonably necessary for the communication; and (5) the content (but not necessarily the form) of the material is not modified in the course of transmission. Thus, for example, an e-mail transmission may appear to the recipient without bolding or italics resulting from format codes contained in the sender’s message.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee intends the term “selection of the material” in subsection (a)(2) to reflect an editorial function of determining what material to send, or the specific sources of material to place online ( e.g., a radio station), rather than “an automatic technical process” of responding to a command or request, such as one from a user, an Internet location tool, or another network. The term “automatic response to the request of another” is intended to encompass a service provider’s actions in responding to requests by a user or other networks, such as requests to forward e-mail traffic or to route messages to a mailing list agent (such as a Listserv) or other discussion group. The Committee intends subsection (a)(4) to cover copies made of material while it is <i>en route</i> to its destination, such as copies made on a router or mail server, storage of a web page in the course of transmission to a specific user, store and forward functions, and other transient copies that occur en route. The term “ordinarily accessible” is intended to encompass stored material that is routinely accessible to third parties. For example, the fact that an illegal intruder might be able to obtain access to the material would not make it ordinarily accessible to third parties. Neither, for example, would occasional access in the course of maintenance by service provider personnel, nor access by law enforcement officials pursuant to subpoena make the material “ordinarily accessible.” However, the term does not include copies made by a service provider for the purpose of making the material available to other users. Such copying is addressed in subsection (b).</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (b)–System caching.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (b) applies to a different form of intermediate and temporary storage than is addressed in subsection (a). In terminology describing current technology, this storage is a form of “caching,” which is used on some networks to increase network performance and to reduce network congestion generally, as well as to reduce congestion and delays to popular sites. This storage is intermediate in the sense that the service provider serves as an intermediary between the originating site and ultimate user. The material in question is stored on the service provider’s system or network for some period of time to facilitate access by users subsequent to the one who previously sought access to it.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>For subsection (b) to apply, the material must be made available on an originating site, transmitted at the direction of another person through the system or network operated by or for the service provider to a different person, and stored through an automatic technical process so that users of the system or network who subsequently request access to the material from the originating site may obtain access to the material from the system or network.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 43&gt;</span><A name="Page43"></A> Subsections (b)(1) through (b)(5) further refine the circumstances under which subsection (b) applies. Subsection (b)(1) provides that the material must be transmitted to subsequent users without modification to its content in comparison to the way it was originally transmitted from the originating site. The Committee intends that this restriction apply, for example, so that a service provider who caches material from another site does not change the advertising associated with the cached material on the originating site without authorization from the originating site.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (b)(2) limits the applicability of the subsection to circumstances where the service provider complies with certain updating commands.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (b)(3) provides that the service provider shall not interfere with the ability of certain technology that is associated with the work by the operator of the originating site to return to the originating site information, such as user “hit” counts, that would have been available to the site had it not been cached. The technology must: (i) not significantly interfere with the performance of the storing provider’s system or network or with intermediate storage of the material; (ii) be consistent with generally accepted industry standard communications protocols applicable to Internet and online communications, such as those approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium; and (iii) not extract information beyond that which would have been obtained had the subsequent users obtained access to the material directly on the originating site.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (b)(4) applies to circumstances in which the originating site imposes a prior condition on access.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (b)(5) establishes a notification and take down procedure for cached material modeled on the procedure under subsection (c). However, this take down obligation does not apply unless the material has previously been removed from the originating site, or the party submitting the notification has obtained a court order for it to be removed from the originating site and notifies the service provider’s designated agent of that order. This proviso has been added to subsection (b)(5) because storage under subsection (b) occurs automatically and unless infringing material has been removed from the originating site, the infringing material would ordinarily simply be re-cached.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Information stored on service providers.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (c) limits the liability of qualifying service providers for claims of direct, vicarious and contributory infringement for storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider. Examples of such storage include providing server space for a user’s web site, for a chatroom, or other forum in which material may be posted at the direction of users. Subsection (c) defines the scope of this limitation on liability. It also sets forth procedural requirements that copyright owners or their agents and service providers must follow with respect to notifications of claimed infringement under subsection (c)(3). Information that resides on the system or network operated by or for the service provider through its own acts or decisions and not at the direction of a user does not fall within the liability limitation of subsection (c).</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 44&gt;</span><A name="Page44"></A> <span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'> Subsection (c)(1)–In general.</span></span> <i>–</i>Subsection (c)(1)(A) sets forth the applicable knowledge standard. This standard is met either by actual knowledge of infringement or in the absence of such knowledge by awareness of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. The term “activity” is intended to mean activity using the material on the system or network. The Committee intends such activity to refer to wrongful activity that is occurring at the site on the provider’s system or network at which the material resides, regardless of whether copyright infringement is technically deemed to occur at that site or at the location where the material is received. For example, the activity at an online site offering audio or video may be unauthorized public performance of a musical composition, a sound recording, or an audio-visual work, rather than (or in addition to) the creation of an unauthorized copy of any of these works.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) can best be described as a “red flag” test. As stated in subsection (l), a service provider need not monitor its service or affirmatively seek facts indicating infringing activity (except to the extent consistent with a standard technical measure complying with subsection (h)), in order to claim this limitation on liability (or, indeed any other limitation provided by the legislation). However, if the service provider becomes aware of a “red flag” from which infringing activity is apparent, it will lose the limitation of liability if it takes no action. The “red flag” test has both a subjective and an objective element. In determining whether the service provider was aware of a “red flag,” the subjective awareness of the service provider of the facts or circumstances in question must be determined. However, in deciding whether those facts or circumstances constitute a “red flag”–in other words, whether infringing activity would have been apparent to a reasonable person operating under the same or similar circumstances–an objective standard should be used.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(1)(A)(iii) provides that once a service provider obtains actual knowledge or awareness of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or activity on the service provider’s system or network is apparent, the service provider does not lose the limitation of liability set forth in subsection (c) if it acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material. Because the factual circumstances and technical parameters may vary from case to case, it is not possible to identify a uniform time limit for expeditious action.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(1)(B) sets forth the circumstances under which a service provider would lose the protection of subsection (c) by virtue of its benefit from and control over infringing activity. In determining whether the financial benefit criterion is satisfied, courts should take a common-sense, fact-based approach, not a formalistic one. In general, a service provider conducting a legitimate business would not be considered to receive a “financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity” where the infringer makes the same kind of payment as non-infringing users of the provider’s service. Thus, receiving a one-time set-up fee and flat periodic payments for service from a person engaging in infringing activities would not constitute receiving a “financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity.” Nor is subparagraph (B) intended <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 45&gt;</span><A name="Page45"></A> to cover fees based on the length of the message (per number of bytes, for example) or by connect time. It would however, include any such fees where the value of the service lies in providing access to infringing material.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(1)(C) establishes that in cases where a service provider is notified of infringing activity by a copyright owner or its authorized agent, in accordance with the notification procedures of subsection (c)(3), the limitation on the service provider’s liability shall be maintained only if the service provider acts expeditiously either to remove the infringing material from its system or to prevent further access to the infringing material on the system or network. This “notice and takedown” procedure is a formalization and refinement of a cooperative process that has been employed to deal efficiently with network-based copyright infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 512 does not require use of the notice and take-down procedure. A service provider wishing to benefit from the limitation on liability under subsection (c) must “take down” or disable access to infringing material residing on its system or network of which it has actual knowledge or that meets the “red flag” test, even if the copyright owner or its agent does not notify it of a claimed infringement. On the other hand, the service provider is free to refuse to “take down” the material or site, even after receiving a notification of claimed infringement from the copyright owner; in such a situation, the service provider’s liability, if any, will be decided without reference to section 512(c). For their part, copyright owners are not obligated to give notification of claimed infringement in order to enforce their rights. However, neither actual knowledge nor awareness of a red flag may be imputed to a service provider based on information from a copyright owner or its agent that does not comply with the notification provisions of subsection (c)(3), and the limitation of liability set forth in subsection (c) may apply.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)(2)–Designated agent.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (c)(2) provides that to qualify for the liability limitation of subsection (c), the service provider must designate an agent to receive notifications under subsection (c)(1)(C). The designation, provided to the Register of Copyrights, and made available on the service provider’s web site is to contain certain information necessary to communicate with the service provider concerning allegedly infringing material or activity. The Register of Copyrights is directed to maintain a directory of designated agents available for inspection by the public, both on the web site of the Library of Congress, and in hard copy format on file at the Copyright Office. The Committee does not intend or anticipate that the Register will publish hard copies of the directory. The directory shall have entries for the name, address, telephone number and electronic mail address of an agent designated by service providers. The service provider’s designation shall substantially comply with these elements.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)(3)–Elements of notification.</span></span> <i>–</i>Subsection (c)(3) sets forth the procedures under which copyright owners and their agents may provide effective notification to a service provider of allegations of infringement on the provider’s system or network. Subsection (c)(3)(A) requires that to count as an effective notification, the notification must be in writing and submitted to the service provider’s designated agent.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 46&gt;</span><A name="Page46"></A> Subsections (c)(3)(A)(i)-(vi) then set forth the information to be included in an effective notification. The standard against which a notification is to be judged is one of substantial compliance. Subsection (c)(3)(A)(i) provides that the notification must be signed by the copyright owner or its authorized agent to be effective. The requirement for signature, either physical or electronic, relates to the verification requirements of subsections (c)(3)(A)(v) and (vi). Subsection (c)(3)(A)(ii) requires that the copyright owner identify the copyrighted work alleged to be infringed. Where multiple works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site is sufficient. Thus, where a party is operating an unauthorized Internet jukebox from a particular site, it is not necessary for a compliant notification to list every musical composition or sound recording that has been or could be infringed at that site, so long as a representative list of those compositions or recordings is provided so that the service provider can understand the nature and scope of the infringement being claimed.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii) requires that the copyright owner or its authorized agent provide the service provider with information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to identify and locate the allegedly infringing material. An example of such sufficient information would be a copy or description of the allegedly infringing material and the URL address of the location (web page) which is alleged to contain the infringing material. The goal of this provision is to provide the service provider with adequate information to find and address the allegedly infringing material expeditiously.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(3)(A)(iv) requires that the copyright owner or its authorized agent provide reasonably sufficient identifying information concerning the owner or its agent who submits the notification, such as an address, telephone number, and if available an electronic mail address so that the service provider may contact the complaining party.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(3)(A)(v) makes clear that the notification from complaining parties must contain a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(3)(A)(vi) specifies that the notification must contain a statement that the information contained therein is accurate. The complaining party–whether the copyright owner, or an authorized representative–also must confirm under penalty of perjury, that it has authority to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is alleged to be infringed. The term “perjury” is used in the sense found elsewhere in the United States Code. See 28 U.S.C. 1746; 18 U.S.C. 1621.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (c)(3)(B) addresses the effect of notifications that do not substantially comply with the requirements of subsection (c)(3). Under this subsection, the court shall not consider such notifications as evidence of whether the service provider has actual knowledge, is aware of facts or circumstances, or has received a notification for purposes of subsection (c)(1)(A). However, a defective notice provided to the designated agent may be considered in evaluating <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 47&gt;</span><A name="Page47"></A> the service provider’s knowledge or awareness of facts and circumstances, if (i) the complaining party has provided the requisite information concerning the identification of the copyrighted work, identification of the allegedly infringing material, and information sufficient for the service provider to contact the complaining party, and (ii) the service provider does not promptly attempt to contact the person making the notification or take other reasonable steps to assist in the receipt of notification that substantially complies with paragraph (3)(A). If the service provider subsequently receives a substantially compliant notice, the provisions of paragraph (1)(C) would then apply upon receipt of the notice.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Committee intends that the substantial compliance standard in subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3) be applied so that technical errors (such as misspelling a name, supplying an outdated area code if the phone number is accompanied by an accurate address, or supplying an outdated name if accompanied by an e-mail address that remains valid for the successor of the prior designated agent or agent of a copyright owner) do not disqualify service providers and copyright owners from the protections afforded under subsection (c). The Committee expects that the parties will comply with the functional requirements of the notification provisions–such as providing sufficient information so that a designated agent or the complaining party submitting a notification may be contacted efficiently–in order to ensure that the notification and take down procedures set forth in this subsection operate smoothly.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (d)–Information location tools.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (d) applies to referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity using information location tools. The reference to “infringing activity” is intended to refer to wrongful activity that is occurring at the location to which the link or reference refers, without regard to whether copyright infringement is technically deemed to occur at that location or at the location where the material is received. The term information location tools includes, for example: a directory or index of online sites or material such as a search engine that identifies pages by specified criteria, a reference to other online material such as a list of recommended sites, a pointer that stands for an Internet location or address, or a hypertext link which allows users to access material without entering its address.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (d) incorporates the notification and take down structure of subsection (c) and applies it to the provision of references and links to infringing sites. A service provider is entitled to the liability limitations of subsection (d) if it: (1) lacks actual knowledge of infringement on the other site, and is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity in that location is apparent; (2) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity on the site, where the service provider has the right and ability to control the infringing activity; and (3) responds expeditiously to remove or disable the reference or link upon receiving a notification of claimed infringement as described in subsection (c)(3). The notification procedures under subsection (d) follow those set forth in subsection (c). However, the information submitted by the complaining party under subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii) is identification of the reference or link to infringing <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 48&gt;</span><A name="Page48"></A> material or activity, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate that reference or link.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 512(d) provides a safe harbor that would limit the liability of a service provider that refers or links users to an online location containing infringing material or activity by using “information location tools,” such as hyperlink directories and indexes. A question has been raised as to whether a service provider would be disqualified from the safe harbor based solely on evidence that it had viewed the infringing Internet site. If so, there is concern that online directories prepared by human editors and reviewers, who view and classify various Internet sites, would be denied eligibility to the information location tools safe harbor, in an unintended number of cases and circumstances. This is an important concern because such online directories play a valuable role in assisting Internet users to identify and locate the information they seek on the decentralized and dynamic networks of the Internet.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Like the information storage safe harbor in section 512(c), a service provider would qualify for this safe harbor if, among other requirements, it “does not have actual knowledge that the material or activity is infringing” or, in the absence of such actual knowledge, it is “not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.” Under this standard, a service provider would have no obligation to seek out copyright infringement, but it would not qualify for the safe harbor if it had turned a blind eye to “red flags” of obvious infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>For instance, the copyright owner could show that the provider was aware of facts from which infringing activity was apparent if the copyright owner could prove that the location was clearly, at the time the directory provider viewed it, a “pirate” site of the type described below, where sound recordings, software, movies or books were available for unauthorized downloading, public performance or public display. Absent such “red flags” or actual knowledge, a directory provider would not be similarly aware merely because it saw one or more well known photographs of a celebrity at a site devoted to that person. The provider could not be expected, during the course of its brief cataloguing visit, to determine whether the photograph was still protected by copyright or was in the public domain; if the photograph was still protected by copyright, whether the use was licensed; and if the use was not licensed, whether it was permitted under the fair use doctrine.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The important intended objective of this standard is to exclude sophisticated “pirate” directories–which refer Internet users to other selected Internet sites where pirate software, books, movies, and music can be downloaded or transmitted–from the safe harbor. Such pirate directories refer Internet users to sites that are obviously infringing because they typically use words such as “pirate,” “bootleg,” or slang terms in their uniform resource locator (URL) and header information to make their illegal purpose obvious to the pirate directories and other Internet users. Because the infringing nature of such sites would be apparent from even a brief and casual viewing, safe harbor status for a provider that views such a site and then establishes a link to it would not be appropriate. Pirate directories do not follow the routine business practices of legitimate service providers preparing directories, and thus <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 49&gt;</span><A name="Page49"></A> evidence that they have viewed the infringing site may be all that is available for copyright owners to rebut their claim to a safe harbor.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In this way, the “red flag” test in section 512(d) strikes the right balance. The common-sense result of this “red flag” test is that on-line editors and catalogers would not be required to make discriminating judgments about potential copyright infringement. If, however, an Internet site is obviously pirate, then seeing it may be all that is needed for the service provider to encounter a “red flag.” A provider proceeding in the face of such a red flag must do so without the benefit of a safe harbor.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Information location tools are essential to the operation of the Internet; without them, users would not be able to find the information they need. Directories are particularly helpful in conducting effective searches by filtering out irrelevant and offensive material. The Yahoo! directory, for example, currently categorizes over 800,000 online locations and serves as a “card catalogue” to the World Wide Web, which over 35,000,000 different users visit each month. Directories such as Yahoo!’s usually are created by people visiting sites to categorize them. It is precisely the human judgment and editorial discretion exercised by these cataloguers which makes directories valuable.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This provision is intended to promote the development of information location tools generally, and Internet directories such as Yahoo!’s in particular, by establishing a safe-harbor from copyright infringement liability for information location tool providers if they comply with the notice and takedown procedures and other requirements of subsection (d). The knowledge or awareness standard should not be applied in a manner which would create a disincentive to the development of directories which involve human intervention. Absent actual knowledge, awareness of infringement as provided in subsection (d) should typically be imputed to a directory provider only with respect to pirate sites or in similarly obvious and conspicuous circumstances, and not simply because the provider viewed an infringing site during the course of assembling the directory.</p>

<a name="q">
<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (e)–Misrepresentations.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (e) establishes a right of action against any person who knowingly misrepresents that material or activity online is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification under the “put back” procedure set forth in subsection (f). Actions may be brought under subsection (e) by any copyright owner, copyright owner’s licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as a result of the service provider relying upon the misrepresentation in either taking down material or putting material back online. Defendants who make such a knowing misrepresentation are liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys” fees, incurred by any of these parties as a result of the service provider’s reliance upon the misrepresentation. <span class=TreatiseQuoted>This subsection is intended to deter knowingly false allegations to service providers in recognition that such misrepresentations are detrimental to rights holders, service providers, and Internet users.</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (f)–Immunity for take downs and user put back procedure.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (f) provides immunity to service providers for <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 50&gt;</span><A name="Page50"></A> taking down infringing material, and establishes a “put back” procedure under which subscribers may contest a complaining party’s notification of infringement provided under subsection (c)(3). The put back procedures were added as an amendment to this title in order to address the concerns of several members of the Committee that other provisions of this title established strong incentives for service providers to take down material, but insufficient protections for third parties whose material would be taken down.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (f)(1) immunizes service providers from any claim based on the service provider’s good faith disabling of access to, or removal of, material or activity claimed to be infringing. The immunity also applies to material or activity that a service provider disables access to or removes based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. This immunity applies even if the material or activity is ultimately determined not to be infringing. The purpose of this subsection is to protect service providers from liability to third parties whose material service providers take down in a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of subsection (c)(1).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (f)(2) establishes a “put back” procedure through an exception to the immunity set forth in subsection (f)(1). The exception applies in a case in which the service provider, pursuant to a notification provided under subsection (c)(1)(C) in accordance with subsection (c)(3), takes down material that a subscriber has posted to the system or network. In such instances, to retain the immunity set forth in subsection (f)(1) with respect to the subscriber whose content is taken down, the service provider is to follow up to three steps.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Under subsection (f)(2)(A), the service provider is to take reasonable steps to notify the subscriber promptly of the removal or disabling of access to the subscriber’s material. The Committee intends that “reasonable steps” include, for example, sending an e-mail notice to an e-mail address associated with a posting, or if only the subscriber’s name is identified in the posting, sending an e-mail to an e-mail address that the subscriber submitted with its subscription. The Committee does not intend that this subsection impose any obligation on service providers to search beyond the four corners of a subscriber’s posting or their own records for that subscriber in order to obtain contact information. Nor does the Committee intend to create any right on the part of subscribers who submit falsified information in their postings or subscriptions to complain if a service provider relies upon the information submitted by the subscriber.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The subscriber may then file a counter notification, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (f)(3), contesting the original take down on grounds of mistake or misidentification of the material and requesting “put back” of the material that the service provider has taken down. If a subscriber files a counter notification with the service provider’s designated agent, subparagraph (f)(2) calls for the service provider to promptly forward a copy to the complaining party who submitted the take down request. Finally, under subsection (f)(2)(C), the service provider is to place the subscriber’s material back online or cease disabling access to it between 10 and 14 business days after receiving the counter notification <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 51&gt;</span><A name="Page51"></A> unless the designated agent receives a further notice from the complaining party that the complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity on the service provider’s system or network with regard to the material in question.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subscriber counter notifications must substantially comply with defined requirements set forth in subsection (f)(3). Notifications shall be signed by the subscriber physically or by electronic signature; identify the material taken down and the location from which it was taken down; include a statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was taken down as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and include the subscriber’s contact information, as well as a statement consenting to the jurisdiction of a Federal district court and to accept service of process from the complaining party or the complaining party’s agent. The substantial compliance standard is the same as that set forth in subsections (c)(2) and (3).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (f)(4) is included to make clear the obvious proposition that a service provider’s compliance with the put back procedure does not subject it to liability for copyright infringement or cause it to lose its liability limitation with respect to the replaced material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (g)–Identification of direct infringer. </span></span><i>–</i>Subsection (g) creates a procedure by which copyright owners or their authorized agents who have submitted or will submit a request for notification satisfying the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(A) may obtain an order for identification of alleged infringers who are users of a service provider’s system or network. Under this procedure, the copyright owner or agent files three documents with the clerk of any U.S. District Court: a copy of the notification, a proposed order, and a sworn declaration that the purpose of the order is to obtain the identity of an alleged infringer and that the information obtained will only be used to protect the owner’s rights under this Title.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Orders issued under subsection (g) shall authorize and order the service provider expeditiously to disclose to the person seeking the order information sufficient to identify the alleged infringer to the extent such information is available to the service provider. The Committee intends that an order for disclosure be interpreted as requiring disclosure of information in the possession of the service provider, rather than obliging the service provider to conduct searches for information that is available from other systems or networks. The Committee intends that such orders be expeditiously issued if the notification meets the provisions of subsection (c)(3)(A) and the declaration is properly executed. The issuing of the order should be a ministerial function performed quickly for this provision to have its intended effect. After receiving the order, the service provider shall expeditiously disclose to the copyright owner or its agent the information required by the order to the extent that the information is available to the service provider, regardless of whether the service provider responds to the notification of claimed infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (h)–Conditions for eligibility.&nbsp;</span></span><i>–</i>Subsection (h) sets forth two conditions that a service provider must satisfy to be eligible <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 52&gt;</span><A name="Page52"></A> for the limitations of liability provided in subsections (a) through (d).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>First, the service provider is expected to adopt and reasonably implement a policy for the termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of subscribers<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=FNRef>24</span></a> of the provider’s service who are repeat online infringers of copyright. The Committee recognizes that there are different degrees of online copyright infringement, from the inadvertent to the noncommercial, to the willful and commercial. In addition, the Committee does not intend this provision to undermine the principles of subsection (l) or the knowledge standard of subsection (c) by suggesting that a provider must investigate possible infringements, monitor its service, or make difficult judgments as to whether conduct is or is not infringing. However, those who repeatedly or flagrantly abuse their access to the Internet through disrespect for the intellectual property rights of others should know that there is a realistic threat of losing that access.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Second, a provider’s system must accommodate, and not interfere with, standard technical measures used to identify or protect copyrighted works. The Committee believes that technology is likely to be the solution to many of the issues facing copyright owners and service providers in this digital age. For that reason, we have included subsection (h)(1)(B), which is intended to encourage appropriate technological solutions to protect copyrighted works. The Committee strongly urges all of the affected parties expeditiously to commence voluntary, interindustry discussions to agree upon and implement the best technological solutions available to achieve these goals.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (h)(1)(B) is explicitly limited to “standard technical measures” that have been developed pursuant to a broad consensus of both copyright owners and service providers in an open, fair, voluntary, multi-industry standards process. The Committee anticipates that these provisions could be developed both in recognized open standards bodies or in ad hoc groups, as long as the process used is open, fair, voluntary, and multi-industry and the measures developed otherwise conform to the requirements of the definition of standard technical measures set forth in paragraph (h)(2). A number of recognized open standards bodies have substantial experience with Internet issues. The Committee also notes that an ad-hoc approach has been successful in developing standards in other contexts, such as the process that has developed copy protection technology for use in connection with DVD.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (i)–Injunctions.&nbsp;</span></span><i>–</i>Subsection (i) defines the terms and conditions under which an injunction may be issued against a service provider that qualifies for the limitations of liability set forth in subsections (a) through (d), but is otherwise subject to an injunction under existing principles of law. Subsection (i)(1) limits the scope of injunctive relief that may be ordered against a qualifying <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 53&gt;</span><A name="Page53"></A> provider. Subsection (i)(2) identifies factors a court must consider in deciding whether to grant injunctive relief and in determining the appropriate scope of injunctive relief.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (i)(1)–Scope of relief.</span></span>&nbsp;–Subsection (i)(1) is divided into two subparagraphs. Subparagraph (A) defines the scope of injunctive relief available against service providers who qualify for the limitations of liability set forth in subsections (b), (c) or (d). Only three forms of injunctive relief may be granted. First, the court may provide for the removal or blocking of infringing material or activity that is residing at a specific location on the provider’s system or network. This is essentially an order to take the actions identified in subsection (c)(1)(C) to “remove, or disable access” to the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Second, the court may order the provider to terminate the accounts of a subscriber<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=FNRef>25</span></a> of the provider’s service who is engaging in infringing activity.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (i)(1)(A) permits the court, under appropriate circumstances, to enter a different form of injunction if the court considers it necessary to prevent or restrain infringement of specific copyrighted material that resides at an identified online location. If a court enters an injunction other than that contemplated in the first two clauses of subparagraph (A), the court must determine that the injunctive relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among those forms of relief that are comparably effective.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (i)(1)(B) sets forth a different set of remedies available for injunctions against service providers qualifying for the limitation on remedies set forth in subsection (a). In such cases, if a court determines that injunctive relief is appropriate, it may only grant injunctive relief in one or both of two specified forms. The first is an order to the service provider to terminate subscriber accounts that are specified in the order. The second form of relief, available in cases in which a provider is engaging in infringing activity relating to a foreign online location, is an order to take reasonable steps to block access to a specific, identified foreign online location. Such blocking orders are not available against a service provider qualifying under subsection (a) in the case of infringing activity on a site within the United States or its territories.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (i)(2)–Considerations.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (i)(2) sets forth mandatory considerations for the court beyond those that exist under current law. These additional considerations require the court to consider factors of particular significance in the digital online environment.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading5Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (i)(3)–Notice and ex parte orders</span></span><i>.&nbsp;–S</i>ubsection (i)(3) prohibits most forms of ex parte injunctive relief (including temporary and preliminary relief) against a service provider qualifying for a liability limitation under section 512. A court may issue an order to ensure the preservation of evidence or where the order will have no material adverse effect on the operation of the provider’s network.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (j)–Definitions.&nbsp;</span></span><i>–</i>Subsection (j) sets forth two definitions of the term “service provider” as used in this title, as well as <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 54&gt;</span><A name="Page54"></A> a definition of the term “monetary relief.” Only an entity that is performing the functions of a “service provider” is eligible for the limitations on liability set forth in section 512 with respect to those functions.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first definition of a service provider, set forth in subsection (j)(1)(A), defines a narrower range of functions and applies to use of the term in subsection (a). As used in that subsection the term “service provider” means any entity offering the transmission, routing or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of a user’s choosing without modification to the content of the material as sent or received. This freestanding definition is derived from the definition of “telecommunications” found in 47 U.S.C. 153(48) in recognition of the fact that the functions covered by this definition are conduit activities, but the Committee has reworked the definition and written subsection (j)(1)(A) to make it appropriate for the Internet and online media. Thus, the subsection (j)(1)(A) definition includes the offering of transmission, routing or providing of connections. Although the transmission, routing or providing of connections may occur over digital or analog networks, the service provider must be providing such services for communications that are both digital and online. By online communications, the Committee intends to refer to communications over an interactive computer network, such as the Internet. Thus, over-the-air broadcasting, whether in analog or digital form, or a cable television system, or a satellite television service would not qualify, except to the extent it provides users with online access to a digital network such as the Internet, or it provides transmission, routing or connections to connect material to such a network, and then only with respect to those functions. An entity is not disqualified from being a “service provider” because it alters the form of the material, so long as it does not alter the content of the material. As a threshold matter, a service provider’s performance of a particular function with respect to allegedly infringing activity falls within the (j)(1)(A) definition of service provider if and only if such function is within the range of functions set forth in subsection (j)(1)(A). For example, hosting a World Wide Web site does not fall within the subsection (j)(1)(A) definition; providing connectivity for a world wide web site does fall within that definition. The subparagraph (A) definition of service provider is not intended to exclude providers that perform other functions in addition to those set forth in subparagraph (A), including the functions <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 55&gt;</span><A name="Page55"></A> identified in subsection (j)(1)(B). Conversely, the fact that a provider performs some functions that fall within the definition of subparagraph (A) does not imply that its other functions that do not fall within the definition of subparagraph (A) qualify for the limitation of liability under subsection (a).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second definition of “service provider,” set forth in subsection (j)(1)(B), applies to the term as used in any other subsection of section 512. This definition is broader than the first, covering providers of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefor. This definition includes, for example, services such as providing Internet access, e-mail, chat room and web page hosting services. The (j)(1)(B) definition of service provider, for example, includes universities and schools to the extent they perform the functions identified in subsection (j)(1)(B). The definition also specifically includes any entity that falls within the first definition of service provider. A broadcaster or cable television system or satellite television service would not qualify, except to the extent it performs functions covered by (j)(1)(B).</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Finally, subsection (j)(2) defines the term “monetary relief” broadly for purposes of this section as encompassing damages, costs, attorneys’ fees and any other form of monetary payment.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (k)–Other defenses not affected.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (k) clarifies that other defenses under copyright law are not affected and codifies several important principles.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>New section 512 does not define what is actionable copyright infringement in the online environment, and does not create any new exceptions to the exclusive rights under copyright law. The rest of the Copyright Act sets those rules. Similarly, new section 512 does not create any new liabilities for service providers or affect any defense available to a service provider. Enactment of section 512 does not bear upon whether a service provider is or is not an infringer when its conduct falls within the scope of section 512. Even if a service provider’s activities fall outside the limitations on liability specified in the bill, the service provider is not necessarily an infringer; liability in these circumstances would be adjudicated based on the doctrines of direct, vicarious or contributory liability for infringement as they are articulated in the Copyright Act and in the court decisions interpreting and applying that statute, which are unchanged by section 512. In the event that a service provider does not qualify for the limitation on liability, it still may claim all of the defenses available to it under current law. New section 512 simply defines the circumstances under which a service provider, as defined in this Section, may enjoy a limitation on liability for copyright infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (l)–Protection of privacy.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (l) is designed to protect the privacy of Internet users. This subsection makes clear that the applicability of subsections (a) through (d) is no way conditioned on a service provider: (1) monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity except to the extent consistent with implementing a standard technical measure under subsection (h); or (2) accessing, removing or disabling access to material if such conduct is prohibited by law, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (m)–Rule of construction.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (m) establishes a rule of construction applicable to subsections (a) through (d). Section 512’s limitations on liability are based on functions, and each limitation is intended to describe a separate and distinct function. Consider, for example, a service provider that provides a hyperlink to a site containing infringing material which it then caches on its system in order to facilitate access to it by its users. This service provider is engaging in at least three functions that may be subject to the limitation on liability: transitory digital network communications under subsection (a), system caching under subsection (b), and information location tools under subsection (d). If this service provider (as defined in subsection (j)(1)(A) in the case of transitory digital communications, or as defined in subsection (j)(1)(B) in the case of system caching or information location tools) meets the <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 56&gt;</span><A name="Page56"></A> threshold criteria spelled out in subsection (h)(1), then for its acts of system caching defined in subsection (b), it may avail itself of the liability limitations stated in subsection (b), which incorporate the limitations on injunctive relief described in subsection (i)(1)(B) and (i)(3). If it is claimed that the same company is committing an infringement by using information location tools to link its users to infringing material, as defined in subsection (d), then its fulfillment of the requirements to claim the system caching liability limitation does not affect whether it qualifies for the liability limitation for information location tools; the criteria in subsection (d), rather than those in subsection (b), are applicable. Section 512(m) codifies this principle by providing that the determination of whether a service provider qualifies for one liability limitation has no effect on the determination of whether it qualifies for a separate and distinct liability limitation under another subsection of section 512.</p>

<h3>Section 203. Conforming amendment</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This section amends the table of sections for chapter 5 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 501 et. seq.) to reflect the new section 512, as created by this title.</p>

<h3>Section 204. Liability of educational institutions for online infringement of copyright</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection 204(a) directs the Register of Copyrights to consult with representatives of copyright owners and nonprofit educational institutions and to submit to the Congress within 6 months after enactment of the bill recommendations regarding the liability of nonprofit educational institutions for copyright infringements that take place through the use of the institution’s computer system or network, where the institution qualifies as a “service provider” under the provisions of this Title. Included in the Register’s report are to be any recommendations for legislation that the Register considers appropriate.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection 204(b) sets forth specific considerations that the Register shall take into account, where relevant, in formulating her recommendations to the Congress.</p>

<h2>Title III–Computer Maintenance Or Repair</h2>

<h3>Section 301. Limitation on exclusive rights; computer programs</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>This section effects a minor, yet important clarification in section 117 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 117) to ensure that the lawful owner or lessee of a computer machine may authorize an independent service provider–a person unaffiliated with either the owner or lessee of the machine–to activate the machine for the sole purpose of servicing its hardware components. When a computer is activated, certain software or parts thereof is automatically copied into the machine’s random access memory, or “RAM”. A clarification in the Copyright Act is necessary in light of judicial decisions holding that such copying is a “reproduction” under section 106 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 106)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=FNRef>26</span></a> thereby calling into question the right of an independent service provider who is not the licensee of <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 57&gt;</span><A name="Page57"></A> the computer program resident on the client’s machine to even activate that machine for the purpose of servicing the hardware components. This section does not in any way alter the law with respect to the scope of the term “reproduction” as it is used in the Copyright Act. Rather, this section it is narrowly crafted to achieve the objectives just described–namely, ensuring that an independent service provider may turn on a client’s computer machine in order to service its hardware components, provided that such service provider complies with the provisions of this section designed to protect the rights of copyright owners of computer software.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraphs (1) and (2) make technical changes to the structure of section 117, dividing the existing provisions between two subsections, the first entitled “(a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy” and the second entitled “(b) Lease, Sale, or Other Transfer of Additional Copy or Adaptation.” The operative provisions, and limitations, are in paragraph (3), which creates two new subsections in section 117, subsections (c) and (d).</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (c)–Machine maintenance or repair.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>The bill creates a new subsection (c) in section 117 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 117), which delineates the specific circumstances under which a reproduction of a computer program would not constitute infringement of copyright. The goal is to maintain undiminished copyright protection afforded under the Copyright Act to authors of computer programs, while making it possible for third parties to perform servicing of the hardware. This new subsection states that it is not an infringement of copyright for the owner or lessee of a machine to make or authorize the making of a copy of a computer program provided that the following conditions are met:</p>

<p class=Paragraph>First, subsection (c) itself makes clear that the copy of the computer program must have been made solely and automatically by virtue of turning on the machine in order to perform repairs or maintenance on the hardware components of the machine. Moreover, the copy of the computer program which is reproduced as a direct and sole consequence of activation must be an authorized copy that has lawfully been installed in the machine. Authorized copies of computer programs are only those copies that have been made available with the consent of the copyright owner. Also, the acts performed by the service provider must be authorized by the owner or lessee of the machine.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Second, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1), the resulting copy may not be used by the person performing repairs or maintenance of the hardware components of the machine in any manner other than to effectuate the repair or maintenance of the machine. Once these tasks are completed, the copy of the program must be destroyed, which generally will happen automatically once the machine is turned off.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Third, as is made clear in paragraph (c)(2), the amendment is not intended to diminish the rights of copyright owners of those computer programs, or parts thereof, that also may be loaded into RAM when the computer is turned on, but which did not need to be so loaded in order for the machine to be turned on. A hardware manufacturer or <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 58&gt;</span><A name="Page58"></A> software developer might, for example, provide diagnostic and utility programs that load into RAM along with or as part of the operating system, even though they market those programs as separate products–either as freestanding programs, or pursuant to separate licensing agreements. Indeed, a password or other technical access device is sometimes required for the owner of the machine to be able to gain access to such programs. In other cases, it is not the hardware or software developer that has arranged for certain programs automatically to be reproduced when the machine is turned on; rather, the owner of the machine may have configured its computer to load certain applications programs into RAM as part of the boot-up process (such as a word processing program on a personal computer). This subsection is not intended to derogate from the rights of the copyright owners of such programs. In order to avoid inadvertent copyright infringement, these programs need to be covered by subsection (c), but only to the extent that they are automatically reproduced when the machine is turned on. This subsection is not intended to legitimize unauthorized access to and use of such programs just because they happen to be resident in the machine itself and are reproduced with or as a part of the operating system when the machine is turned on. According to paragraph (c)(2), if such a program is accessed or used without the authorization of the copyright owner, the initial reproduction of the program shall not be deemed exempt from infringement by this subsection.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=Heading4Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Subsection (d)–Definitions.</span></span><i>&nbsp;–</i>Subsection (d) defines two terms not previously defined by the Copyright Act. Paragraph (1) defines the term “maintenance” as the servicing of the machine in order to make it work in accordance with its original specifications and any changes to those specifications authorized for that machine. These acts can include, but are not limited to, cleaning the machine, tightening connections, installing new components such as memory chips, circuit boards and hard disks, checking the proper functioning of these components, and other similar acts.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Paragraph (2) defines the term “repair” as the restoring of the machine to the state of working in accordance with its original specifications and any changes to those specifications authorized for that machine. These acts of repairing the hardware include, but are not limited to, replacing worn or defective components such as memory chips, circuit boards and hard disks, correcting the improper installation of new components, and other similar acts.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Both paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection are subject to the same limitations, which are intended to clarify that activating a machine in order to perform maintenance or repair does not constitute infringement as provided in subsection (c) if the maintenance or repair is undertaken to make the machine work in accordance with the parameters specified for such a machine and its component parts. Because technological improvements may lead customers to upgrade their machines, the language of both definitions authorizes service providers to maintain those components of the hardware that have been installed since the time the machine was <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 59&gt;</span><A name="Page59"></A> originally acquired, or to install new components. But their acts shall be noninfringing under subsection (c) only if the components being serviced have been lawfully acquired and installed. Finally, the terms “maintenance” and “repair” do not include unauthorized adaptations, modifications, error corrections or any other changes to any software which may be in the machine being serviced.</p>

<h2>Title IV–Ephemeral Recordings; Distance Education; Exemption For Libraries And Archives</h2>

<h3>Section 401. Ephemeral recordings</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 401 amends section 112 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 112) to address two issues concerning the application of the ephemeral recording exemption in the digital age.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first of these issues is the relationship between the ephemeral recording exemption and the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 (“DPRA”). The DPRA granted sound recording copyright owners the exclusive right to perform their works publicly by means of digital audio transmission, subject to certain limitations, particularly those set forth in section 114(d). Among those limitations is an exemption for nonsubscription broadcast transmissions, which are defined as those made by terrestrial broadcast stations licensed as such by the FCC. 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(A)(iii) and (j)(2). The ephemeral recording exemption presently privileges certain activities of a transmitting organization when it is entitled to transmit a performance or display under a license or transfer of copyright ownership or under the limitations on exclusive rights in sound recordings specified by section 114(a). The Committee believes that the ephemeral recording exemption should apply to broadcast radio and television stations when they make nonsubscription digital broadcasts permitted by the DPRA. The Committee has therefore changed the existing language of the ephemeral recording exemption (redesignated as 112(a)(1)) to extend explicitly to broadcasters the same privilege they already enjoy with respect to analog broadcasts.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second of these issues is the relationship between the ephemeral recording exemption and the anticircumvention provisions that the bill adds as section 1201 of the Copyright Act. Concerns were expressed that if use of copy protection technologies became widespread, a transmitting organization might be prevented from engaging in its traditional activities of assembling transmission programs and making ephemeral recordings permitted by section 112 for purposes of its own transmissions within its local service area and of archival preservation and security. To address this concern, the Committee has added to section 112 a new paragraph that permits transmitting organizations to engage in activities that otherwise would violate section 1201(a)(1) in certain limited circumstances when necessary for the exercise of the transmitting organization’s privilege to make ephemeral recordings under redesignated section 112(a)(1). By way of example, if a radio station could not make a permitted ephemeral recording from a commercially available phonorecord without violating section 1201(a)(1), then the radio station could request from the copyright owner the necessary means of making a permitted ephemeral recording. If the <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 60&gt;</span><A name="Page60"></A> copyright owner did not then either provide a phonorecord that could be reproduced or otherwise provide the necessary means of making a permitted ephemeral recording from the phonorecord already in the possession of the radio station, the radio station would not be liable for violating section 1201(a)(1) for taking the steps necessary for engaging in activities permitted under section 112(a)(1). The radio station would, of course, be liable for violating section 1201(a)(1) if it engaged in activities prohibited by that section in other than the limited circumstances permitted by section 112(a)(1).</p>

<h3>Section 402. Limitation on exclusive rights; distance education</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 402(a) directs the Register of Copyrights to consult with representatives of copyright owners, nonprofit educational institutions, and nonprofit libraries and archives and to submit recommendations to the Congress no later than 6 months after the date of enactment of the bill on how to promote distance education through digital technologies, including interactive digital networks, while maintaining an appropriate balance between the rights of copyright owners and the needs of users. Where appropriate, the Register shall include legislative recommendations to achieve those objectives.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 402(b) specifies considerations which the Register shall take into account in formulating such recommendations.</p>

<h3>Section 403. Exemption for libraries and archives</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 108 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 108) permits libraries and archives of the type described in that section to make and, in some cases, distribute a limited number of copies of certain types of copyrighted works, without the permission of the copyright holder, for specified purposes relating to these entities’ functions as repositories of such works for public reference. Section 403 of the bill updates section 108 to allow these entities to take advantage of digital technologies when engaging in specified preservation activities.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Except for the amendment to paragraph (a)(3), which deals with the inclusion of copyright notice on all copies or phonorecords of works made or distributed pursuant to section 108, the amendments revise either subsection (b), which addresses the reproduction and distribution of a copy or phonorecord of an unpublished work for purposes of preservation and security or for deposit for research use in another library or archive of the type described; or subsection (c), which addresses the reproduction of a copy or phonorecord of a published work for the purpose of replacement of a copy of that work that is damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, if an unused replacement copy cannot be obtained at a fair price.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The amendment to paragraph (a)(3) of section 108 is intended to ease the burden on libraries and archives of the current law’s requirement that a notice of copyright be included on copies that are reproduced under section 108. Under this amendment, such notice would be required only where the particular copy that is reproduced by the library or archives itself bears a notice. In other words, a notice appearing on the material copied would still need to be maintained, and could not be deleted. On the other hand, if <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 61&gt;</span><A name="Page61"></A> the copy being reproduced does not bear a copyright notice, the library or archives would fully satisfy its obligation under this section by simply placing on the reproduction a legend that states “This work may be protected by copyright,” or words to that effect. This minimal obligation is similar to those found in subsections (e) and (f) of existing section 108, which condition the exemption in those subsections on the display of a general notice or warning of potential copyright protection.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (b) currently permits a library or archive under this section to make and distribute one copy or phonorecord of an unpublished work solely for purposes of preservation and security or for deposit for research use in another library or archives, provided that the duplication of the work occurs “in facsimile form.” The legislative history to that section makes clear that, when this language was enacted more than twenty years ago, Congress intended to permit the copy to be made by microfilm or electrostatic photocopying process, but not in a computerized form i.e., “in machine readable language for storage in an information system.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=FNRef>27</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The amendment to subsection (b) permits a library or archive to make (for itself or another library or archive of the type described by clause (2) of subsection (a)) up to 3 copies or phonorecords for these purposes, rather than just one, and permits such copies or phonorecords to be made in digital as well as analog formats. In recognition of the risk that uncontrolled public access to the copies or phonorecords in digital formats could substantially harm the interests of the copyright owner by facilitating immediate, flawless and widespread reproduction and distribution of additional copies or phonorecords of the work, the amendment provides that any copy of a work that the library or archive makes in a digital format must not be otherwise distributed in that format and must not be made available in that format to the public outside the premises of the library or archives. In this way, the amendment permits the utilization of digital technologies solely for the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Similarly, subsection (c) currently permits a library or archives under this section to make one copy or phonorecord of any published work solely for purposes of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is damaged, deteriorating, lost or stolen, provided that the library or archive has determined after a reasonable effort that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price, and provided that the duplication of the work occurs “in facsimile form.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>As in subsection (b), the amendment to subsection (c) permits a library or archive to make and use three copies or phonorecords for these purposes, rather than just one, and permits such copies or phonorecords to be made in digital as well as analog formats, with the proviso that any copy of a work that the library or archive makes in a digital format must not be made available to the public in that format except for use on the premises of a library or archives in lawful possession of such copy. In the view of the Committee, this proviso is necessary to ensure that the amendment strikes the appropriate balance, permitting the use of digital technology by libraries and archives while guarding against the potential <span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page 62&gt;</span><A name="Page62"></A> harm to the copyright owner’s market from patrons obtaining unlimited access to digital copies from any location.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The amendment to subsection (c) also broadens its coverage to allow the updating of obsolete formats. It permits the making of such copies or phonorecords of a work “if the existing format in which the work is stored has become obsolete.” This provision is intended to permit libraries and archives to ensure that copies of works in their collections continue to be accessible and useful to their patrons. In order to ensure that the provision does not inadvertently result in the suppression of ongoing commercial offerings of works in still-usable formats, the amendment explicitly provides that, for purposes of this subsection, a format will be considered obsolete only if the machine or device necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or reasonably available in a commercial marketplace. Under this language, if the needed machine or device can only be purchased in second-hand stores, it should not be considered “reasonably available.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Finally, the Committee wants to make clear that, just as when section 108 of the Copyright Act was first enacted, the term “libraries” and “archives” as used and described in this provision still refer to such institutions only in the conventional sense of entities that are established as, and conduct their operations through, physical premises in which collections of information may be used by researchers and other members of the public. Although online interactive digital networks have since given birth to online digital “libraries” and “archives” that exist only in the virtual (rather than physical) sense on websites, bulletin boards and homepages across the Internet, it is not the Committee’s intent that section 108 as revised apply to such collections of information. The ease with which such sites are established online literally allows anyone to create his or her own digital “library” or “archives.” The extension of the application of section 108 to all such sites would be tantamount to creating an exception to the exclusive rights of copyright holders that would permit any person who has an online website, bulletin board or a homepage to freely reproduce and distribute copyrighted works. Such an exemption would swallow the general rule and severely impair the copyright owners’ right and ability to commercially exploit their copyrighted works. Consequently, the Committee intends that references to “the premises of the library or archives” in amended sections 108 (b)(2) and (c)(2) mean only physical premises.</p>

<p class=Name>No Electronic Theft (NET) Act</p>

<p class=CaseCite>143 Cong. Rec. S12689</p>

<p class=Court>Congressional Record --- Senate Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, First Session Thursday</p>

<p class=CaseDate>November 13, 1997</p>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>Mr. Hatch.</b></p>

<p class=Paragraph> Mr. President, I rise in support of passage of H.R. 2265, The No Electronic Theft (NET) Act. This bill plugs the “LaMacchia Loophole” in criminal copyright enforcement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Current sec. 506(a) of the Copyright Act contains criminal penalties for willful copyright infringement for “commercial advantage or private financial gain.” In U.S. versus LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), defendant, a graduate student attending MIT, encouraged lawful purchasers of copyrighted computer games and other software to upload these works via a special password to an electronic bulletin board on the Internet. The defendant then transferred the works to another electronic address and urged other persons with access to a second password to download the materials for personal use without authorization by or compensation to the copyright owners. Because the defendant never benefited financially from any of these transactions, the current criminal copyright infringement could not be used. Furthermore, the court held that neither could the federal wire fraud statute, since Congress never envisioned protecting copyrights under that statute. For persons with few assets, civil liability is not an adequate deterrent.</p>

<p class=Paragraph> It is obvious that great harm could be done to copyright owners if this practice were to become widespread. Significant losses to copyright holders would undermine the monetary incentive to create which is recognized in our Constitution. Mr. President, I believe that willful, commercial-scale pirating of copyrighted works, even when the pirate receives no monetary reward, ought to be nipped in the bud. This bill does that.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>I will admit, Mr. President, that I initially had concerns about this bill. I was afraid that the language was so broad that the net could be cast too widely-pardon the pun-so that minor offenders or persons who honestly believed that they had a legitimate right to engage in the behavior prohibited by the bill would be swept in. What of the educator who feels that his or her action is a fair use of the copyrighted work? Although the bill is not failsafe, because of the severity of the potential losses to copyright owners from widespread LaMacchia-like behavior and the little time remaining in this session, on balance I was persuaded to support the bill.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>I place great store by the “willfulness” requirement in the bill. Although there is on-going debate about what precisely is the “willfulness” standard in the Copyright Act-as the House Report records-I submit that in the LaMacchia context “willful” ought to mean the intent to violate a known legal duty. The Supreme Court has given the term “willful” that construction in numerous cases in the past 25 years, for example: U.S. versus Bishop, 412 U.S. 346 (1973); U.S. versus Pomponio, 429 U.S. 987 (1976); Cheek versus U.S., 498 U.S. 192 (1991); and Ratzlaf versus U.S., 510 U.S. 135 (1994). As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that is the interpretation that I give to this term. Otherwise, I would have objected and not allowed this bill to pass by unanimous consent. Under this standard, then, an educator who in good faith believes that he or she is engaging in a fair use of copyrighted material could not be prosecuted under the bill.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>I am also relying upon the good sense of prosecutors and judges. Again, the purpose of the bill is to prosecute commercial-scale pirates who do not have commercial advantage or private financial gain from their illegal activities. But if an over-zealous prosecutor should bring and win a case against a college prankster, I am confident that the judge would exercise the discretion that he or she may have under the Sentencing Guidelines to be lenient. If the practical effect of the bill turns out to be draconian, we may have to revisit the issue.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In addition to my concern that the bill's scope might be too broad, I wanted to make sure that the language of the bill would not prejudice in any way the debate about the copyright liability of on-line and Internet service providers. Mr. President, there are good arguments on both sides of the issue, and I will shortly begin the process of bringing the parties together to try to obtain a mutually agree-upon solution to this problem. It is my understanding that representatives of the OSP/ISP community and the fair use community were consulted during the passage of the bill in the House. This tends to confirm my judgment that the bill was not intended to affect the OSP/ISP liability debate.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, I would like to point out two areas that are susceptible to interpretation mischief. </p>

<p class=Paragraph>First,<span class=SourcePN>&lt;Page S12690&gt;</span><A name="PageS12690"></A> the bill amends the term “financial gain” as used in the Copyright Act to include “receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including receipt of other copyrighted works.” The intent of the change is to hold criminally liable those who do not receive or expect to receive money but who receive tangible value. It would be contrary to the intent of the provision, according to my understanding, if “anything of value” would be so broadly read as to include enhancement of reputation or value remote from the criminal act, such as a job promotion.</p>

<a name="q">
<p class=Paragraph>Second, I am concerned about the interplay between criminal liability for “reproduction” in the bill and the commonly-held view that the loading of a computer program into random access memory (RAM) is a reproduction for purposes of the Copyright Act. <span class=TreatiseQuoted>Because most shrink-wrap licenses purport to make the purchaser of computer software a licensee and not an owner of his or her copy of the software, the ordinary purchaser of software may not be able to take advantage of the exemption provided by sec. 117, allowing the “owner” of a copy to reproduce the work in order to use it in his or her computer.</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=TreatiseQuoted>Many shrink-wrap licenses limit the purchaser to making only a single backup copy of his or her software. Thus, under a literal reading of the bill, the ordinary purchaser of computer software who loaded the software enough times in the 180-day period to reach the more-than-$1,000 threshold may be a criminal. This is, of course, not the intent of the bill. Clearly, this kind of copying was not intended to be criminalized.</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Additionally, Congress has long recognized that it is necessary to make incidental copies of digital works in order to use them on computers. Programs or data must be transferred from a floppy disk to a hard disk or from a hard disk into RAM as a necessary step in their use. Modern operating systems swap data between RAM and hard disk to use the computer memory more efficiently. Given its purpose, it is not the intent of this bill to have the incidental copies made by the user of digital work be counted more than once in computing the total retail value of the infringing reproductions.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>As you can see, Mr. President, I do not believe this is the perfect bill, but it is a good bill that addresses a serious problem that has the potential of very soon undermining copyright in many works, not just computer software. I am confident that prosecutors and the courts will make their decisions with the purpose of the bill in mind-the elimination of willful, commercial-scale pirating of copyrighted works.</p>

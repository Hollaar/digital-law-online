<h3>III.B.9. Special Rules for Schools</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Subsection (e) provides special protection for schools if their faculty or student employees are infringing, by not attributing that infringement to the school in many instances.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>When a public or other nonprofit institution of higher education is a service provider, and when a faculty member or graduate student who is an employee of such institution is performing a teaching or research function, for the purposes of subsections (a) and (b) such faculty member or graduate student shall be considered to be a person other than the institution, and for the purposes of subsections (c) and (d) such faculty member’s or graduate student’s knowledge or awareness of his or her infringing activities shall not be attributed to the institution, if—</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(A) such faculty member’s or graduate student’s infringing activities do not involve the provision of online access to instructional materials that are or were required or recommended, within the preceding 3-year period, for a course taught at the institution by such faculty member or graduate student;</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(B) the institution has not, within the preceding 3-year period, received more than 2 notifications described in subsection (c)(3) of claimed infringement by such faculty member or graduate student, and such notifications of claimed infringement were not actionable under subsection (f); and</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(C) the institution provides to all users of its system or network informational materials that accurately describe, and promote compliance with, the laws of the United States relating to copyright.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the limitations on injunctive relief contained in subsections (j)(2) and (j)(3), but not those in (j)(1), shall apply. <span class=footnote>{FN124: <a HREF="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html">17 U.S.C. §512</a>(e)}</span> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>This provision was not part of the DMCA as passed by either the House or the Senate but was added by the conference committee as it was considering the final form of the bill.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>   However, the conferees recognize that the university environment is unique. Ordinarily, a service provider may fail to qualify for the liability limitations in Title II simply because the knowledge or actions of one of its employees may be imputed to it under basic principles of respondeat superior and agency law. The special relationship which exists between universities and their faculty members (and their graduate student employees) when they are engaged in teaching or research is different from the ordinary employer-employee relationship. Since independence—freedom of thought, word and action—is at the core of academic freedom, the actions of university faculty and graduate student teachers and researchers warrant special consideration in the context of this legislation. This special consideration is embodied in new subsection (e), which provides special rules for determining whether universities, in their capacity as a service provider, may or may not be liable for acts of copyright infringement by faculty members or graduate students in certain circumstances.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>   Subsection (e)(1) provides that the online infringing actions of faculty members or graduate student employees, which occur when they are “performing a teaching or research function,” will not be attributed to an institution of higher education in its capacity as their employer for purposes of section 512, if certain conditions are met. For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of section 512, such faculty member or graduate student shall be considered to be a person other than the institution, and for the purposes of subsections (c) and (d) of section 512 the faculty member’s or graduate student’s knowledge or awareness of his or her infringing activities will not be attributed to the institution, when they are performing a teaching or research function and the conditions in paragraphs (A) (C) are met.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>   When the faculty member or the graduate student employee is performing a function other than teaching or research, this subsection provides no protection against liability for the institution if infringement occurs. For example, a faculty member or graduate student is performing a function other than teaching or research when the faculty member or graduate student is exercising institutional administrative responsibilities, or is carrying out operational responsibilities that relate to the institution’s function as a service provider. Further, for the exemption to apply on the basis of research activity, the research must be a genuine academic exercise—i.e. a legitimate scholarly or scientific investigation or inquiry—rather than an activity which is claimed to be research but is undertaken as a pretext for engaging in infringing activity.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>   In addition to the “teaching or research function” test, the additional liability protections contained in subsection (e)(1) do not apply unless the conditions in paragraphs (A) through (C) are satisfied. First, paragraph (A) requires that the infringing activities must not involve providing online access to instructional materials that are “required or recommended” for a course taught by the infringing faculty member and/or the infringing graduate student within the last three years. The reference to “providing online access” to instructional materials includes the use of e-mail for that purpose. The phrase “required or recommended” is intended to refer to instructional materials that have been formally and specifically identified in a list of course materials that is provided to all students enrolled in the course for credit; it is not intended, however, to refer to the other materials which, from time to time, the faculty member or graduate student may incidentally and informally bring to the attention of students for their consideration during the course of instruction.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>   Second, under paragraph (B) the institution must not have received more than two notifications of claimed infringement with respect to the particular faculty member or particular graduate student within the last three years. If more than two such notifications have been received, the institution may be considered to be on notice of a pattern of infringing conduct by the faculty member or graduate student, and the limitation of subsection (e) does not apply with respect to the subsequent infringing actions of that faculty member or that graduate student. Where more than two notifications have previously been received with regard to a particular faculty member or graduate student, the institution will only become potentially liable for the infringing actions of that faculty member or that graduate student. Any notification of infringement that gives rise to a cause of action for misrepresentation under subsection (f) does not count for purposes of paragraph (B).</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>   Third, paragraph (C) states that the institution must provide to the users of its system or network&nbsp;– whether they are administrative employees, faculty, or students&nbsp;– materials that accurately describe and promote compliance with copyright law. The legislation allows, but does not require, the institutions to use relevant informational materials published by the U.S. Copyright Office in satisfying the condition imposed by paragraph (C). <span class=footnote>{FN125: <a HREF="misc/HRep105-796.pdf">H.R. Rep. No. 105-796</a> at 74-75}</span> </p>

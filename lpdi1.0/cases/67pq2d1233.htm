<p class=Name>In re Aimster Copyright Litigation</p>

<p class=Court>U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit</p>

<p class=CaseDate>June 30, 2003</p>

<p class=CaseCite>334 F.3d 643, 67 USPQ2d 1233</p>

<p class=Judge>Posner, J. </p>

<p class=Judge></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Owners of copyrighted popular music filed a number of
closely related suits, which were consolidated and transferred to the Northern
District of Illinois by the Multidistrict Litigation Panel, against John Deep
and corporations that are controlled by him and need not be discussed
separately. The numerous plaintiffs, who among them appear to own most
subsisting copyrights on American popular music, claim that Deep’s “Aimster”
Internet service (recently renamed “Madster”) is a contributory and vicarious
infringer of these copyrights. The district judge entered a broad preliminary
injunction, which had the effect of shutting down the Aimster service until the
merits of the suit are finally resolved, from which Deep appeals. Aimster is
one of a number of enterprises (the former Napster is the best known) that have
been sued for facilitating the swapping of digital copies of popular music,
most of it copyrighted, over the Internet. (For an illuminating discussion, see
Tim Wu, “When Code Isn’t Law,” 89 <i>Va. L. Rev</i>. 679 (2003), esp. 723-41;
and with special reference to Aimster, see Alec Klein, “Going Napster One
Better; Aimster Says Its File-Sharing Software Skirts Legal Quagmire,” <i>Wash.
Post</i>, Feb. 25, 2001, p. A1.) To simplify exposition, we refer to the
appellant as “Aimster” and to the appellees (the plaintiffs) as the recording
industry.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Teenagers and young adults who have access to the Internet
like to swap computer files containing popular music. If the music is
copyrighted, such swapping, which involves making and transmitting a digital
copy of the music, infringes copyright. The swappers, who are ignorant or more
commonly disdainful of copyright and in any event discount the likelihood of
being sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement, are the direct infringers.
But firms that facilitate their infringement, even if they are not themselves
infringers because they are not making copies of the music that is shared, may
be liable to the copyright owners as contributory infringers. Recognizing the
impracticability or futility of a copyright owner’s suing a multitude of
individual infringers (“chasing individual consumers is time consuming and is a
teaspoon solution to an ocean problem,” Randal C. Picker, “Copyright as Entry
Policy: The Case of Digital Distribution,”47 <i>Antitrust Bull.</i> 423, 442
(2002)), the law allows a copyright holder to sue a contributor to the
infringement instead, in effect as an aider and abettor. Another analogy is to
the tort of intentional interference with contract, that is, inducing a breach
of contract. See, e.g., <i>Sufrin v. Hosier</i>, 128 F.3d 594, 597 (7th Cir.
1997). If a breach of contract (and a copyright license is just a type of
contract) can be prevented most effectively by actions taken by a third party,
it makes sense to have a legal mechanism for placing liability for <span
class=SourcePN>W:646</span> the consequences of the breach on him as well as on
the party that broke the contract.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The district judge ruled that the recording industry had
demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits should the case proceed
to trial. He so ruled with respect to vicarious as well as contributory
infringement; we begin with the latter, the more familiar charge.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Aimster system has the following essential components:
proprietary software that can be downloaded free of charge from Aimster’s Web
site; Aimster’s server (a server is a computer that provides services to other
computers, in this case personal computers owned or accessed by Aimster’s
users, over a network), which hosts the Web site and collects and organizes
information obtained from the users but does not make copies of the swapped
files themselves and that also provides the matching service described below;
computerized tutorials instructing users of the software on how to use it for
swapping computer files; and “Club Aimster,” a related Internet service owned
by Deep that users of Aimster’s software can join for a fee and use <span
class=SourcePN>PQ:1236</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:navy'> </span>to download the “top 40” popular-music files more easily
than by using the basic, free service. The “AIM” in “Aimster” stands for AOL
instant-messaging service. Aimster is available only to users of such services
(of which AOL’s is the most popular) because Aimster users can swap files only
when both are online and connected in a chat room enabled by an
instant-messaging service.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Someone who wants to use Aimster’s basic service for the
first time to swap files downloads the software from Aimster’s Web site and
then registers on the system by entering a user name (it doesn’t have to be his
real name) and a password at the Web site. Having done so, he can designate any
other registrant as a “buddy” and can communicate directly with all his buddies
when he and they are online, attaching to his communications (which are really
just emails) any files that he wants to share with the buddies. All
communications back and forth are encrypted by the sender by means of
encryption software furnished by Aimster as part of the software package
downloadable at no charge from the Web site, and are decrypted by the recipient
using the same Aimster-furnished software package. If the user does not
designate a buddy or buddies, then <i>all</i> the users of the Aimster system
become his buddies; that is, he can send or receive from any of them.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Users list on their computers the computer files they are
willing to share. (They needn’t list them separately, but can merely designate
a folder in their computer that contains the files they are willing to share.)
A user who wants to make a copy of a file goes online and types the name of the
file he wants in his “Search For” field. Aimster’s server searches the
computers of those users of its software who are online and so are available to
be searched for files they are willing to share, and if it finds the file that
has been requested it instructs the computer in which it is housed to transmit
the file to the recipient via the Internet for him to download into his
computer. Once he has done this he can if he wants make the file available for
sharing with other users of the Aimster system by listing it as explained
above. In principle, therefore, the purchase of a single CD could be levered
into the distribution within days or even hours of millions of identical,
near-perfect (depending on the compression format used) copies of the music
recorded on the CD—hence the recording industry’s anxiety about file-sharing
services oriented toward consumers of popular music. But because copies of the
songs reside on the computers of the users <span class=SourcePN>W:647</span>
and not on Aimster’s own server, Aimster is not a direct infringer of the
copyrights on those songs. Its function is similar to that of a stock exchange,
which is a facility for matching offers rather than a repository of the things
being exchanged (shares of stock). But unlike transactions on a stock exchange,
the consummated “transaction” in music files does not take place in the
facility, that is, in Aimster’s server.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>What we have described so far is a type of Internet
file-sharing system that might be created for innocuous purposes such as the
expeditious exchange of confidential business data among employees of a
business firm. See Daniel Nasaw, “Instant Messages Are Popping Up All Over,” <i>Wall
St. J.</i>, June 12, 2003, p. B4; David A. Vise, “AOL Makes Instant-Messaging
Deal,” <i>Wash. Post</i>, June 12, 2003, p. E5. The fact that copyrighted
materials might sometimes be shared between users of such a system without the
authorization of the copyright owner or a fair-use privilege would not make the
firm a contributory infringer. Otherwise AOL’s instant-messaging system, which
Aimster piggybacks on, might be deemed a contributory infringer. For there is
no doubt that some of the attachments that AOL’s multitudinous subscribers
transfer are copyrighted, and such distribution is an infringement unless
authorized by the owner of the copyright. The Supreme Court made clear in the <i>Sony</i>
decision that the producer of a product that has substantial noninfringing uses
is not a contributory infringer merely because some of the uses actually made
of the product (in that case a machine, the predecessor of today’s
video-cassette recorders, for recording television programs on tape) are
infringing. <i>Sony Corp. of America, Inc. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</i>,
464 U.S. 417 [220 USPQ 665] (1984); see also <i>Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software
Ltd.</i>, 847 F.2d 255, 262-67 [7 USPQ2d 1281] (5th Cir. 1988). How much more
the Court held is the principal issue that divides the parties; and let us try
to resolve it, recognizing of course that the Court must have the last word.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Sony’s Betamax video recorder was used for three principal
purposes, as Sony was well aware (a fourth, playing home movies, involved no
copying). The first, which the majority <span class=SourcePN>PQ:1237</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'> </span>opinion
emphasized, was time shifting, that is, recording a television program that was
being shown at a time inconvenient for the owner of the Betamax for later
watching at a convenient time. The second was “library building,” that is,
making copies of programs to retain permanently. The third was skipping
commercials by taping a program before watching it and then, while watching the
tape, using the fast-forward button on the recorder to skip over the
commercials. The first use the Court held was a fair use (and hence not
infringing) because it enlarged the audience for the program. The copying
involved in the second and third uses was unquestionably infringing to the
extent that the programs copied were under copyright and the taping of them was
not authorized by the copyright owners—but not all fell in either category.
Subject to this qualification, building a library of taped programs was
infringing because it was the equivalent of borrowing a copyrighted book from a
public library, making a copy of it for one’s personal library, then returning
the original to the public library. The third use, commercial-skipping,
amounted to creating an unauthorized derivative work, see <i>WGN Continental
Broadcasting Co. v. United Video, Inc</i>., 693 F.2d 622, 625 [216 USPQ 97]
(7th Cir. 1982); <i>Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Cos.</i>, 538 F.2d 14,
17-19, 23 [192 USPQ 1] (2d Cir. 1976); cf. <i>Ty, Inc. v. GMA Accessories, Inc.</i>,
132 F.3d 1167, 1173 [45 USPQ2d 1519] (7th Cir. 1997), namely a commercial-free
copy that would reduce the copyright owner’s income from his original program, <span
class=SourcePN>W:648</span> since “free” television programs are financed by
the purchase of commercials by advertisers.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Thus the video recorder was being used for a mixture of
infringing and noninfringing uses and the Court thought that Sony could not
demix them because once Sony sold the recorder it lost all control over its
use. <i>Sony Corp. of America, Inc. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
464 U.S at 438. The court ruled that “the sale of copying equipment, like the sale
of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if
the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it
need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses. The question is thus
whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.
In order to resolve that question, we need not explore <i>all</i> the different
potential uses of the machine and determine whether or not they would
constitute infringement. Rather, we need only consider whether on the basis of
the facts as found by the district court a significant number of them would be
non-infringing. Moreover, in order to resolve this case we need not give
precise content to the question of how much use is commercially significant.
For one potential use of the Betamax plainly satisfies this standard, however
it is understood: private, noncommercial time-shifting in the home.” <i>Id</i>.
at 441.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In our case the recording industry, emphasizing the
reference to “articles of commerce” in the passage just quoted and elsewhere in
the Court’s opinion (see <i>id</i>. at 440; cf. 35 U.S.C. §271(c)), and
emphasizing as well the Court’s evident concern that the copyright holders were
trying to lever their copyright monopolies into a monopoly over video recorders,
<i>Sony Corp. of America, Inc. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
464 U.S at 441-42 and n. 21, and also remarking Sony’s helplessness to prevent
infringing uses of its recorders once it sold them, argues that <i>Sony</i> is
inapplicable to services. With regard to services, the industry argues, the
test is merely whether the provider knows it’s being used to infringe
copyright. The industry points out that the provider of a service, unlike the
seller of a product, has a continuing relation with its customers and therefore
should be able to prevent, or at least limit, their infringing copyright by
monitoring their use of the service and terminating them when it is discovered
that they are infringing. Although Sony could have engineered its video recorder
in a way that would have reduced the likelihood of infringement, as by
eliminating the fast-forward capability, or, as suggested by the dissent, <i>id</i>.
at 494, by enabling broadcasters by scrambling their signal to disable the Betamax
from recording their programs (for that matter, it could have been engineered
to have only a play, not a recording, capability), the majority did not discuss
these possibilities and we agree with the recording industry that the ability
of a service provider to prevent its customers from infringing is a factor to
be considered in determining whether the provider is a contributory infringer.
Congress so recognized in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which we
discuss later in this opinion.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>PQ:1238</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>It is not necessarily a controlling factor, however, as the
recording industry believes. If a service facilitates both infringing and
noninfringing uses, as in the case of AOL’s instant-messaging service, and the
detection and prevention of the infringing uses would be highly burdensome, the
rule for which the recording industry is contending could result in the
shutting down of the service or its annexation by the copyright owners
(contrary to the clear <span class=SourcePN>W:649</span> import of the <i>Sony</i>
decision), because the provider might find it impossible to estimate its
potential damages liability to the copyright holders and would anyway face the
risk of being enjoined. The fact that the recording industry’s argument if
accepted might endanger AOL’s instant-messaging service (though the service
might find shelter under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act—a question
complicated, however, by AOL’s intention, of which more later, of offering an
encryption option to the visitors to its chat rooms) is not only alarming; it
is paradoxical, since subsidiaries of AOL’s parent company (AOL Time Warner),
such as Warner Brothers Records and Atlantic Recording Corporation, are among
the plaintiffs in this case and music chat rooms are among the facilities
offered by AOL’s instant-messaging service.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>We also reject the industry’s argument that <i>Sony</i>
provides no defense to a charge of contributory infringement when, in the words
of the industry’s brief, there is anything “more than a mere showing that a
product may be used for infringing purposes.” Although the fact was downplayed
in the majority opinion, it was apparent that the Betamax was being used for
infringing as well as noninfringing purposes—even the majority acknowledged
that 25 percent of Betamax users were fast forwarding through commercials, <i>id</i>.
at 452 n. 36—yet Sony was held not to be a contributory infringer. The Court
was unwilling to allow copyright holders to prevent infringement effectuated by
means of a new technology at the price of possibly denying noninfringing
consumers the benefit of the technology. We therefore agree with Professor
Goldstein that the Ninth Circuit erred in <i>A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster,
Inc.</i>, 239 F.3d 1004, 1020 [57 USPQ2d 1729] (9th Cir. 2001), in suggesting
that actual knowledge of specific infringing uses is a sufficient condition for
deeming a facilitator a contributory infringer. 2 Paul Goldstein, <i>Copyright</i>
§ 6.1.2, p. 6:12-1 (2d ed. 2003)</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The recording industry’s hostility to the <i>Sony</i>
decision is both understandable, given the amount of Internet-enabled
infringement of music copyrights, and manifest—the industry in its brief offers
five reasons for confining its holding to its specific facts. But it is being
articulated in the wrong forum.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Equally, however, we reject Aimster’s argument that to
prevail the recording industry must prove it has actually lost money as a
result of the copying that its service facilitates. It is true that the Court
in <i>Sony</i> emphasized that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had
sustained substantial harm from the Betamax. <i>Id</i>. at 450-54, 456. But the
Court did so in the context of assessing the argument that time shifting of
television programs was fair use rather than infringement. One reason time
shifting was fair use, the Court believed, was that it wasn’t hurting the
copyright owners because it was enlarging the audience for their programs. But
a copyright owner who can prove infringement need not show that the
infringement caused him a financial loss. Granted, without such a showing he
cannot obtain compensatory damages; but he can obtain statutory damages, or an
injunction, just as the owner of physical property can obtain an injunction
against a trespasser without proving that the trespass has caused him a
financial loss.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>What is true is that when a supplier is offering a product
or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of
the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of
contributory infringement. The Court’s action in striking the cost-benefit
tradeoff in favor of Sony came to seem <span class=SourcePN>W:650</span> prescient
when it later turned out that the principal use of video recorders was to allow
people to watch at home movies that they bought or rented rather than to tape
television programs. (In 1984, when <i>Sony</i> was decided, the industry was
unsure how great the demand would be for prerecorded tapes compared to time
shifting. The original Betamax played one-hour tapes, long enough for most
television broadcasts but too short for a feature film. Sony’s competitors used
the VHS format, which came to market later but with a longer playing time; this
contributed to VHS’s eventual displacement of Betamax.) An enormous new market
thus opened for the movie <span class=SourcePN>PQ:1239</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'> </span>industry—which by
the way gives point to the Court’s emphasis on potential as well as actual
noninfringing uses. But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only
in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are
demonstrated.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Paragraph>We also reject Aimster’s argument that because the Court
said in <i>Sony</i> that mere “constructive knowledge” of infringing uses is
not enough for contributory infringement, 464 U.S. at 439, and the encryption
feature of Aimster’s service prevented Deep from knowing what songs were being
copied by the users of his system, he lacked the knowledge of infringing uses
that liability for contributory infringement requires. Willful blindness is
knowledge, in copyright law (where indeed it may be enough that the defendant <i>should</i>
have known of the direct infringement, <i>Casella v. Morris</i>, 820 F.2d 362,
365 [3 USPQ2d 1340] (11th Cir. 1987); 2 Goldstein, <i>supra</i>, §6.1, p. 6:6),
as it is in the law generally. See, e.g., <i>Louis Vuitton S.A. v. Lee</i>, 875
F.2d 584, 590 [10 USPQ2d 1935] (7th Cir. 1989) (contributory trademark
infringement). One who, knowing or strongly suspecting that he is involved in
shady dealings, takes steps to make sure that he does not acquire full or exact
knowledge of the nature and extent of those dealings is held to have a criminal
intent, <i>United States v. Giovannetti</i>, 919 F.2d 1223, 1228 (7th Cir. 1990),
because a deliberate effort to avoid guilty knowledge is all that the law
requires to establish a guilty state of mind. <i>United States v. Josefik</i>,
753 F.2d 585, 589 (7th Cir. 1985); <i>AMPAT/Midwest, Inc. v. Illinois Tool
Works Inc.</i>, 896 F.2d 1035, 1042 (7th Cir. 1990) (“to know, and to want not
to know because one suspects, may be, if not the same state of mind, the same
degree of fault).”In <i>United States v. Diaz</i>, 864 F.2d 544, 550 (7th Cir.
1988), the defendant, a drug trafficker, sought “to insulate himself from the
actual drug transaction so that he could deny knowledge of it,” which he did
sometimes by absenting himself from the scene of the actual delivery and
sometimes by pretending to be fussing under the hood of his car. He did not
escape liability by this maneuver; no more can Deep by using encryption
software to prevent himself from learning what surely he strongly suspects to
be the case: that the users of his service—maybe <i>all</i> the users of his
service—are copyright infringers.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This is not to say that the provider of an encrypted
instant-messaging service or encryption software is ipso factor a contributory
infringer should his buyers use the service to infringe copyright, merely
because encryption, like secrecy generally, facilitates unlawful transactions.
(“Encryption” comes from the Greek word for concealment.) Encryption fosters
privacy, and privacy is a social benefit though also a source of social costs. “AOL
has begun testing an encrypted version of AIM [AOL Instant Messaging].
Encryption is considered critical for widespread adoption of IM in some
industries and federal agencies.” Vise, <i>supra</i>. Our point is only that a
service provider that would otherwise be <span class=SourcePN>W:651</span> a
contributory infringer does not obtain immunity by using encryption to shield
itself from actual knowledge of the unlawful purposes for which the service is
being used.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Paragraph>We also do not buy Aimster’s argument that since the Supreme
Court distinguished, in the long passage from the <i>Sony</i> opinion that we
quoted earlier, between actual and potential noninfringing uses, all Aimster
has to show in order to escape liability for contributory infringement is that
its file-sharing system <i>could</i> be used in noninfringing ways, which
obviously it could be. Were that the law, the seller of a product or service
used <i>solely</i> to facilitate copyright infringement, though it was capable
in principle of noninfringing uses, would be immune from liability for
contributory infringement. That would be an extreme result, and one not
envisaged by the <i>Sony</i> majority. Otherwise its opinion would have had no
occasion to emphasize the fact (at least the majority thought it a fact—the
dissent disagreed, 464 U.S. at 458-59) that Sony had not in its advertising
encouraged the use of the Betamax to infringe copyright. <i>Id</i>. at 438. Nor
would the Court have thought it important to say that the Betamax was used “principally”
for time shifting, <i>id</i>. at 421; see also <i>id</i>. at 423, which as we
recall the Court deemed a fair use, or to remark that the plaintiffs owned only
a small percentage of the total amount of copyrighted television programming
and it was unclear how many of the other owners objected to home taping. <i>Id</i>.
at 443; see also <i>id</i>. at 446.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>There are analogies in the law of aiding and abetting, the
criminal counterpart to contributory infringement. A retailer of slinky dresses
is not guilty of aiding and abetting prostitution <span class=SourcePN>PQ:1240</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'> </span>even if he knows
that some of his customers are prostitutes—he may even know which ones are. See
<i>United States v. Giovannetti</i>, <i>supra</i>, 919 F.2d at 1227; <i>People
v. Lauria</i>, 59 Cal. Rptr. 628 (App. 1967); Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N.
Boyce, <i>Criminal Law</i> 746-47 (3d ed. 1982). The extent to which his
activities and those of similar sellers actually promote prostitution is likely
to be slight relative to the social costs of imposing a risk of prosecution on
him. But the owner of a massage parlor who employs women who are capable of
giving massages, but in fact as he knows sell only sex and never massages to
their customers, is an aider and abettor of prostitution (as well as being
guilty of pimping or operating a brothel). See <i>United States v. Sigalow</i>,
812 F.2d 783, 784, 785 (2d Cir. 1987); <i>State v. Carpenter</i>, 701 N.E.2d
10, 13, 18-19 (Ohio App. 1997); cf. <i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera</i>,
63 F.3d 1142, 1149-50 (1st Cir. 1995). The slinky-dress case corresponds to <i>Sony</i>,
and, like <i>Sony</i>, is not inconsistent with imposing liability on the
seller of a product or service that, as in the massage-parlor case, is capable
of noninfringing uses but in fact is used only to infringe. To the recording
industry, a single known infringing use brands the facilitator as a
contributory infringer. To the Aimsters of this world, a single noninfringing
use provides complete immunity from liability. Neither is correct.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Paragraph>To situate Aimster’s service between these unacceptable
poles, we need to say just a bit more about it. In explaining how to use the Aimster
software, the tutorial gives as its <i>only</i> examples of file sharing the
sharing of copyrighted music, including copyrighted music that the recording
industry had notified Aimster was being infringed by Aimster’s users. The
tutorial is the invitation to infringement that the Supreme Court found was
missing in <i>Sony</i>. In addition, membership in Club <span class=SourcePN>W:652</span>
Aimster enables the member for a fee of $4.95 a month to download with a single
click the music most often shared by Aimster users, which turns out to be music
copyrighted by the plaintiffs. Because Aimster’s software is made available
free of charge and Aimster does not sell paid advertising on its Web site, Club
Aimster’s monthly fee is the only means by which Aimster is financed and so the
club cannot be separated from the provision of the free software. When a member
of the club clicks on “play” next to the name of a song on the club’s Web site,
Aimster’s server searches through the computers of the Aimster users who are
online until it finds one who has listed the song as available for sharing, and
it then effects the transmission of the file to the computer of the club member
who selected it. Club Aimster lists only the 40 songs that are currently most
popular among its members; invariably these are under copyright.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The evidence that we have summarized does not exclude the <i>possibility</i>
of substantial noninfringing uses of the Aimster system, but the evidence is
sufficient, especially in a preliminary-injunction proceeding, which is summary
in character, to shift the burden of production to Aimster to demonstrate that
its service has substantial noninfringing uses. (On burden-shifting in
preliminary-injunction proceedings, see <i>FTC v. University Health, Inc.</i>,
938 F.2d 1206, 1218-19 (11th Cir. 1991); cf. <i>Johnson v. Cambridge
Industries, Inc.</i>, 325 F.3d 892, 897 (7th Cir. 2003); <i>SEC v. Lipson</i>,
278 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2002); <i>Liu v. T &amp; H Machine, Inc.</i>, 191
F.3d 790, 795 (7th Cir. 1999).) As it might:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>1. Not all popular music is copyrighted. Apart from music
on which the copyright has expired (not much of which, however, is of interest
to the teenagers and young adults interested in swapping music), startup bands
and performers may waive copyright in the hope that it will encourage the
playing of their music and create a following that they can convert to
customers of their subsequent works.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>2. A music file-swapping service might increase the value
of a recording by enabling it to be used as currency in the music-sharing
community, since someone who only downloads and never uploads, thus acting as a
pure free rider, will not be very popular.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>3. Users of Aimster’s software might form select (as
distinct from all-comers) “buddy” groups to exchange noncopyrighted information
about popular music, or for that matter to exchange ideas and opinions about
wholly unrelated matters as the buddies became friendlier. Some of the
chat-room messages that accompany the listing of music files offered or
requested contain information or opinions concerning the music; to that extent,
though unremarked by the parties, some noninfringing <span class=SourcePN>PQ:1241</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'> </span>use is made of Aimster’s
service, though it is incidental to the infringement.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>4. Aimster’s users might appreciate the encryption feature
because as their friendship deepened they might decide that they wanted to
exchange off-color, but not copyrighted, photographs, or dirty jokes, or other
forms of expression that people like to keep private, rather than just
copyrighted music.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>5. Someone might own a popular-music CD that he was
particularly fond of, but he had not downloaded it into his computer and now he
finds himself out of town but with his laptop and he wants to listen to the CD,
so he uses Aimster’s service to download a copy. This might be a fair use
rather than a copyright infringement, by analogy to the time shifting approved
as fair use in the <i>Sony</i> case. <i>Recording Industry Ass’n of</i> <span
class=SourcePN>W:653</span> <i>America v. Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc.</i>,
180 F.3d 1072, 1079 [51 USPQ2d 1115] (9th Cir. 1999); cf. <i>Vault Corp. v.
Quaid Software Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>, 847 F.2d at 266-67. The analogy was
sidestepped in <i>A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, 239
F.3d at 1019, because Napster’s system did not limit downloading to music on
CDs owned by the downloader. The analogy was rejected in <i>UMG Recordings v.
MP3.com, Inc.</i>, 92 F.Supp.2d 349 [54 USPQ2d 1668] (S.D.N.Y. 2000), on the
ground that the copy on the defendant’s server was an unauthorized derivative
work; a solider ground, in light of <i>Sony</i>’s rejection of the parallel
argument with respect to time shifting, would have been that the defendant’s
method for requiring that its customers “prove”that they owned the CDs
containing the music they wanted to download was too lax.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote></p>

<p class=Paragraph>All five of our examples of actually or arguably
noninfringing uses of Aimster’s service are possibilities, but as should be
evident from our earlier discussion the question is how probable they are. It
is not enough, as we have said, that a product or service be physically
capable, as it were, of a noninfringing use. Aimster has failed to produce any
evidence that its service has ever been used for a noninfringing use, let alone
evidence concerning the frequency of such uses. In the words of the district
judge, “defendants here have provided no evidence whatsoever (besides the
unsupported declaration of Deep) that Aimster is <i>actually</i> used for any
of the stated non-infringing purposes. Absent is any indication from real-life
Aimster users that their primary use of the system is to transfer
non-copyrighted files to their friends or identify users of similar interests
and share information. Absent is any indication that even a single business
without a network administrator uses Aimster to exchange business records as
Deep suggests.” <i>In re Aimster Copyright Litigation</i>, 252 F.Supp.2d 634,
653 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (emphasis in original). We have to assume for purposes of
deciding this appeal that no such evidence exists; its absence, in combination
with the evidence presented by the recording industry, justified the district
judge in concluding that the industry would be likely to prevail in a full
trial on the issue of contributory infringement. Because Aimster failed to show
that its service is ever used for any purpose other than to infringe the
plaintiffs’ copyrights, the question (as yet unsettled, see Wu, <i>supra</i>,
at 708 and nn. 95 and 98) of the net effect of Napsterlike services on the
music industry’s income is irrelevant to this case. If the <i>only</i> effect
of a service challenged as contributory infringement is to enable copyrights to
be infringed, the magnitude of the resulting loss, even whether there is a net
loss, becomes irrelevant to liability.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Even when there are noninfringing uses of an Internet
file-sharing service, moreover, if the infringing uses are substantial then to
avoid liability as a contributory infringer the provider of the service must
show that it would have been disproportionately costly for him to eliminate or
at least reduce substantially the infringing uses. Aimster failed to make that
showing too, by failing to present evidence that the provision of an encryption
capability <i>effective against the service provider itself</i> added important
value to the service or saved significant cost. Aimster blinded itself in the
hope that by doing so it might come within the rule of the <i>Sony</i>
decision.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>It complains about the district judge’s refusal to hold an
evidentiary hearing. But his refusal was consistent with our decision in <i>Ty,
Inc. v. GMA Accessories, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, 132 F.3d at 1171 (citations
omitted), where we explained that “if genuine issues of material fact are
created by <span class=SourcePN>W:654</span> the response to a motion for a
preliminary injunction, an evidentiary hearing is indeed required. But as in
any case in which <span class=SourcePN>PQ:1242</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy'> </span>a party seeks an evidentiary
hearing, he must be able to persuade the court that the issue is indeed genuine
and material and so a hearing would be productive—he must show in other words
that he has and intends to introduce evidence that if believed will so weaken
the moving party’s case as to affect the judge’s decision on whether to issue
an injunction.” Aimster hampered its search for evidence by providing
encryption. It must take responsibility for that self-inflicted wound.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Turning to the second issue presented by the appeal, we are
less confident than the district judge was that the recording industry would
also be likely to prevail on the issue of vicarious infringement should the
case be tried, though we shall not have to resolve our doubts in order to
decide the appeal. “Vicarious liability” generally refers to the liability of a
principal, such as an employer, for the torts committed by his agent, an
employee for example, in the course of the agent’s employment. The teenagers
and young adults who use Aimster’s system to infringe copyright are of course
not Aimster’s agents. But one of the principal rationales of vicarious
liability, namely the difficulty of obtaining effective relief against an
agent, who is likely to be impecunious, Alan O. Sykes, “The Economics of
Vicarious Liability,” 93 <i>Yale L.J</i>. 1231, 1241-42, 1272 (1984), has been
extended in the copyright area to cases in which the only effective relief is
obtainable from someone who bears a relation to the direct infringers that is
analogous to the relation of a principal to an agent. See 2 Goldstein, <i>supra</i>,
§6.2, pp. 6:17 to 6:18. The canonical illustration is the owner of a dance hall
who hires dance bands that sometimes play copyrighted music without
authorization. The bands are not the dance hall’s agents, but it may be
impossible as a practical matter for the copyright holders to identify and
obtain a legal remedy against the infringing bands yet quite feasible for the
dance hall to prevent or at least limit infringing performances. And so the
dance hall that fails to make reasonable efforts to do this is liable as a
vicarious infringer. <i>Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.</i>,
36 F.2d 354, 355 (7th Cir. 1929), and other cases cited in <i>Sony Corp. of
America, Inc. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, 464 U.S. at
437 n. 18; 2 Goldstein, <i>supra</i>, §6.2, pp. 6:18 to 6:20. The dance hall
could perhaps be described as a contributory infringer. But one thinks of a
contributory infringer as someone who benefits directly from the infringement
that he encourages, and that does not seem an apt description of the dance
hall, though it does benefit to the extent that competition will force the
dance band to charge the dance hall a smaller fee for performing if the band
doesn’t pay copyright royalties and so has lower costs than it would otherwise
have.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>How far the doctrine of vicarious liability extends is
uncertain. It could conceivably have been applied in the <i>Sony</i> case
itself, on the theory that while it was infeasible for the producers of
copyrighted television fare to sue the viewers who used the fast-forward button
on Sony’s video recorder to delete the commercials and thus reduce the
copyright holders’ income, Sony could have reduced the likelihood of
infringement, as we noted earlier, by a design change. But the Court, treating
vicarious and contributory infringement interchangeably, see <i>id</i>. at 435
and n. 17, held that Sony was not a vicarious infringer either. By eliminating
the encryption feature and monitoring the use being made of its system, Aimster
could like Sony have limited the amount of infringement. <span class=SourcePN>W:655</span>
Whether failure to do so made it a vicarious infringer notwithstanding the
outcome in <i>Sony</i> is academic, however; its ostrich-like refusal to
discover the extent to which its system was being used to infringe copyright is
merely another piece of evidence that it was a contributory infringer.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Paragraph>We turn now to Aimster’s defenses under the Online Copyright
Infringement Liability Limitation Act, Title II of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. §512; see 2 Goldstein, <i>supra</i>, §6.3. The
DMCA is an attempt to deal with special problems created by the so-called
digital revolution. One of these is the vulnerability of Internet service
providers such as AOL to liability for copyright infringement as a result of
file swapping among their subscribers. Although the Act was not passed with
Napster-type services in mind, the definition of Internet service provider is
broad (“a provider of online services or network access, or the operator of
facilities therefor,” 17 U.S.C. §512(k)(1)(B)), and, as the district judge
ruled, Aimster fits it. See 2 Goldstein, <i>supra</i>, §6.3.1, p. 6:27. The Act
provides a series of safe harbors for Internet service providers and related
entities, but none in which Aimster can moor. The Act does not abolish
contributory <span class=SourcePN>PQ:1243</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:navy'> </span>infringement. The common element of its
safe harbors is that the service provider must do what it can reasonably be
asked to do to prevent the use of its service by “repeat infringers.” 17 U.S.C.
§512(i)(1)(A). Far from doing anything to discourage repeat infringers of the
plaintiffs’ copyrights, Aimster invited them to do so, showed them how they
could do so with ease using its system, and by teaching its users how to
encrypt their unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials disabled itself
from doing anything to prevent infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Paragraph>This completes our discussion of the merits of Aimster’s
appeal. But the fact that the recording industry is likely to win this case if
it is ever tried is not by itself a sufficient basis for the issuance of a
preliminary injunction. A court asked to issue such an injunction must also
consider which party will suffer the greater harm as a result of a ruling for
or against issuance. Aimster points out that the preliminary injunction has put
it out of business; the recording industry ripostes that until it was put out
of business Aimster, with an estimated 2 to 3 million users, undoubtedly was
facilitating a substantial infringement of music copyrights—and remember that Aimster
has presented no evidence of offsetting noninfringing uses. On this record,
therefore, the harm to Aimster from the grant of the injunction must be
reckoned comparable to the harm that the recording industry would suffer from
denial of the preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The only harm that is relevant to the decision to grant a
preliminary injunction is irreparable harm, since if it is reparable by an
award of damages at the end of trial there is no need for preliminary relief.
The recording industry’s harm should the preliminary injunction be dissolved
would undoubtedly be irreparable. The industry’s damages from Aimster’s
contributory infringement cannot be reliably estimated and Aimster would in any
event be unlikely ever to have the resources to pay them. Aimster’s irreparable
harm from the grant of the injunction is, if anything, less, because of the
injunction bond of $500,000 that the industry was required to post and that
Aimster does not contend is inadequate. (Even without the bond, the recording
industry would undoubtedly be good for any damages that Aimster may have
sustained from being temporarily shut down, though, bond or no bond, there is
still the measurement <span class=SourcePN>W:656</span> problem.) Even if the
irreparable harms are deemed the same, since the plaintiffs have a stronger
case on the merits than Aimster does the judge was right to grant the
injunction.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Aimster objects to the injunction’s breadth. But having
failed to suggest alternative language either in the district court or in this
court, it has waived the objection. We cannot find a case that makes this point
expressly, but it is implicit in the general principle that arguments made but
not developed do not preserve issues for appellate review. E.g., <i>Jones Motor
Co. v. Holtkamp, Liese</i>, 197 F.3d 1190, 1192 (7th Cir. 1999). We are not
impressed by Aimster’s argument that the district court had an independent
duty, rooted in the free-speech clause of the First Amendment, to make sure
that the impact of the injunction on communications over the Internet is no
greater than is absolutely necessary to provide the recording industry with the
legal protection to which it is entitled while the case wends its way to a
conclusion. Copyright law and the principles of equitable relief are quite
complicated enough without the superimposition of First Amendment case law on
them; and we have been told recently by the Supreme Court not only that “copyright
law contains built-in First Amendment accommodations” but also that, in any
event, the First Amendment “bears less heavily when speakers assert the right
to make other people’s speeches.” <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft</i>, 123 S.Ct. 769,
788-89 [65 USPQ2d 1225] (2003). Or, we add, to copy, or enable the copying of,
other people’s music.</p>

<h1>REPORT TITLE: Costs of Owning, Borrowing, and Disposing of Periodical Publications</h1>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>CONTRACTOR: Public Research Institute, Cen­ter for Naval Analyses</b></p>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>AUTHORS: Vernon E. Palmour, Marcia C' Bellassai, and Robert R. V. Wiederkehr</b></p>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>NTIS ORDER NO.: PB 274821</b></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>A library has two ways of satisfying its user's requirements for periodical literature: it may either subscribe and keep issues on the shelf, or it may borrow from another library. At low levels of usage, it is cheaper for the library to fulfill patron requirements through borrowing; at higher levels of usage, subscribing is cheaper. This study specifies a mathematical model which states exactly the conditions under which each course of action is preferable from the library's own point of view. The work done for CONTU represents an updating of the model originally developed by the same authors for the Associ­ation of Research Libraries in 1968.</p>

<a name="sec3.2."></a>
<h2>Specifications of the Model</h2>

<a name="sec3.2.1."></a>
<h3>Library Cost Components Included</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Data were collected from three different li­braries to estimate the magnitude of the follow­ing library costs, which vary depending on sub­scription decisions: (1) initial costs of acquiring and cataloging a new title; (2) annual re­curring costs of maintaining and servicing jour­nal materials; (3) internal costs of circulation, reshelving,and lending to others; and (4) in­ternal cost of processing an interlibrary loan transaction.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The model explicitly does not take into ac­count the loss of browsing capacity due to dropping a subscription or the cost in terms of delay to the patron due to borrowing.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Since the fee, if any, a lending library may charge for the use of its materials, or external borrowing cost-may vary widely from case to case, the model takes this as a variable, The levels of journal use at which libraries should either drop or add subscriptions, called the crossover points, are given for different specified external lending fees. Since lending fees often do not exist or do not cover the lending li­brary's costs, interlibrary loan may be unrealis­tically cheap from the borrower's point of view, and the crossover points of journal usage from a social point of view would therefore be higher.</p>

<a name="sec3.2.2."></a>
<h3>Journal Usage over Time and Length of Holdings</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Use of journal literature decays rather rapidly. Almost 80 percent of usage occurs within five years after publication, and almost 95 percent within fifteen years. Based on studies at two large libraries, the model includes two schedules—one for science and technology and one for <span class=SourcePN>{Page 128}</span> the social and life sciences-to take this usage pattern into account.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The number of years of back holdings that a library has on the shelves will vary from journal to journal. However, five requests or uses for a journal with five years of back files does not have the same meaning as five requests for a fifteen-year-old title holding. To account for this, the mathematical model includes a &quot;nor­malization&quot; factor. Since the crossover points are specified for journals with ten years of back holdings, one needs to adjust for the length of a particular journal's back files before applying the add/drop decision criterion supplied by the crossover point.</p>

<a name="sec3.2.3."></a>
<h3>Subscription Prices</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Since subscription prices vary widely, the model specifies crossover points according to different subscription price levels.</p>

<a name="sec3.2.4."></a>
<h3>Planning Period</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>The model uses a twenty-five-year planning period; that is, the library deciding whether to subscribe or borrow is assumed to take into ac­count all costs and user requests up to twenty-five years away but to ignore any years farther in the future.</p>

<a name="sec3.3."></a>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>1. The crossover points are very similar for the decisions both to add a journal title and to drop one. The only difference lies in the li­brary's one-time cost of acquiring a new title.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>2. A typical crossover point for the add/drop decision is four or five uses per journal title per year. This is the result, for example, with a subscription price of forty dollars and external lending fees of eight dollars.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>3.  It is unlikely, then, that libraries will he engaging in much interlibrary lending activity that falls outside the limits specified by the CONTU guidelines (see Part I of this report), which permit each requesting library up to five copies of articles from the most recent five years of each journal title to which it does not sub­scribe. This is especially true given libraries' current tendency to maintain subscriptions even at very low levels of usage.</p>

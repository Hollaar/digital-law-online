<h1>Recommendations of Interested Organizations</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>On October 21, 1977, and April 28, 1978, representatives of the principal library, author, and publisher organizations concerned with photocopying, other than for classroom use, ap­peared before the Commission to make recom­mendations regarding the Commission’s final report.<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span class=FNRef>263</span></a> Testimony was presented by repre­sentatives of the Council of National Library Associations’ Ad Hoc Committee on Copyright Practice and Implementation, which includes <span class=SourcePN>{Page 78}</span> representatives of the following library organiza­tions: Special Libraries Association, Music Li­brary Association, Medical Library Association, Association of Research Libraries, American Li­brary Association, and American Association of Law Libraries. On the same days, represen­tatives of the Authors’ League of America, Inc., and the Association of American Publish­ers also testified. All three groups stated that they wished to see how the provisions relating to photocopying in the 1976 Copyright Act would work in practice. They stated that they did not wish to suggest amendments to the 1976 Act at this time, but preferred to make such recommendations, if any, to the Register of Copyrights under the provisions of section 108 (i), which requires the Register of Copyrights to report to Congress in 1983 on how successfully section 108 has worked out in practice.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Two organizations with which the Commis­sion had contracts to prepare studies on copy­right issues from the point of view of consumers and the general public recommended changes in the 1976 Copyright Act at the July 1977 Com­mission hearings.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class=FNRef>264</span></a> The Public Interest Eco­nomics Center and the Public Interest Satellite Association proposed that the 1976 Act be amended to remove all restrictions on photo­copying except copying for commercial resale. The full text of their recommendations may be found in the reports of the two organizations cited in Appendix H.</p>

Technology Uses of Copyrighted Works</i>

<p class=Chapter>Chapter 4 – Machine Reproduction – Photocopying</p>
<a name="sec6."></a>
<h1>Provisions of the 1976 Copyright Act Affecting Photocopying</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>Sections 107 and 108 of the Copyright Act of 1976 govern photocopying activities.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class=FNRef>213</span></a> An un­derstanding of these sections and their legisla­tive history is necessary to analyze the needs of copyright proprietors and those who seek access to printed works by means of photocopying.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The 1976 Act deals with photocopying in four different ways:</p>

<p class=Paragraph>1. Copying for teaching purposes is dealt with, not by specific statutory exemptions, but rather by a list of permissible practices held to be fair use under section 107. This is accom­plished by means of the so-called educational guidelines, the “Agreement on Guidelines for Classroom Copying in Not-for-Profit Educa­tional Institutions,” which were negotiated by educational, author, and publisher organizations and accepted by the congressional committees.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class=FNRef>214</span></a> <span class=SourcePN>{Page 53}</span> (They will not be dealt with here in any further detail because of the explicit exclusion from the jurisdiction of the Commission of copying done in connection with face-to-face teaching ac­tivities.)</p>

<p class=Paragraph>2. Permissible copying of music for educa­tional use is also covered in guidelines which were negotiated between music publishing organizations and organizations representing music users. The House Committee report sets forth these guidelines.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class=FNRef>215</span></a> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>3. Specific exemptions for photocopying by libraries and archives are set forth in section 108 of the 1976 Act and are discussed in detail in the following sections of this chapter.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>4. By implication, since they are the subject of no specific exemptions or guidelines, the fol­lowing classes of copiers may engage in only fair use copying under the four general stand­ards set forth in section 107 of the act: (a) individuals doing their own copying; (b) libraries and archives not qualifying for the privi­leges of section 108; and (c) organizations which are not libraries or archives, including profit organizations charging fees for copying.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=FNRef>216</span></a> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>Section 108 permits copying of most materials without authorization by libraries or archives for themselves and for their users in specified cir­cumstances provided that: (1) the library or archives is open to the public or available to specialized researchers; (2) the reproduction or distribution includes a notice of copyright; and (3) the reproduction or distribution is made without any purpose of direct or indirect com­mercial advantage.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class=FNRef>217</span></a> This third limitation is in­terpreted in the House report to mean that “direct or indirect commercial advantage” is an intention to profit directly from the sale of copies, rather than to profit from the use of the reproduced material in the business of the organization.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=FNRef>218</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Libraries and archives qualifying for the privileges of section 108 are permitted to make copies for themselves (as opposed to making copies for their patrons or users) only in two cases. Section 108(b) permits a library or archives to reproduce an unpublished work for purposes of preservation, security, or research use in another library if the copy or phonorecord is currently in the collections of the library or archives. Section 108(c) permits libraries and archives to reproduce damaged, deteriorated, lost, or stolen copies if, after a reasonable effort, an unused replacement cannot be ob­tained at a fair price.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Libraries and archives are given more exten­sive privileges of making copies for users both from their own collections and by securing copies from other sources. The principal privi­lege is conferred by section 108(d), which per­mits the making of not more than one copy of an article from a periodical, or other contribu­tion to a copyrighted collection, or a small part of any other copyrighted work, for pur­poses of private study, scholarship, or research, provided that the library displays prominently at the place where orders are accepted and in­cludes in its order forms the warning of copy­right prescribed by regulation of the Register of Copyrights.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Libraries and archives also have the right un­der section 108(e) to make a copy for a user of an <i>entire </i>copyrighted work or a substantial part of it, or to secure a copy from another source, if (1) determination has been made that a copy cannot be obtained at a fair price; (2) the purpose of the requester is private study, scholarship, or research; and (3) the prescribed warning by the Register of Copyrights is dis­played and included on the order form.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>All of the rights to make copies that are enu­merated in section 108 are limited by the pro­hibition in section 108(g) against “the related or concerted reproduction . . . of multiple copies . . . of the same material” and the “sys­tematic reproduction or distribution” of periodical articles or other small portions of copy­righted works. This prohibition against sys­tematic reproduction and distribution, however, is in turn limited by the proviso in section 108(g) (2), which states “[t]hat nothing in this clause prevents a library or archives from participating in interlibrary arrangements that do not have, as their purpose or effect, that the library or archives receiving such copies or phonorecords for distribution does so in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for a subscription <span class=SourcePN>{Page 54}</span> to or purchase of such work.” The aggregate quantities that constitute a substitution for a subscription or purchase of a work are defined in the CONTU guidelines, which are de­scribed in the next section.</p>

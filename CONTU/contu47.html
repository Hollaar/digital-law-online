<h1>REPORT TITLE: Survey of Publisher Practices and Current Attitudes on Authorized Journal Article Copying and Licensing</h1>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>CONTRACTOR: Research Center for Library and Information Science, Graduate Library School, Indiana University at Bloomington</b></p>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>AU'THORS: Bernard M. Fry, Herbert S. White, and Elizabeth L Johnson</b></p>

<p class=ParaNonIndent><b>NTIS ORDER NO.: PB 271 003</b></p>

<a name="sec5.1."></a>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1975, the Indiana Graduate Library School completed a large-scale study, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), on the acquisition of materials by libraries and the economic status of scholarly, scientific, and technical journals, which depend heavily on libraries as a market. The study involved the analysis of questionnaires filled out by libraries and journal publishers. The libraries surveyed showed a marked shift in their materials budgets from books to periodicals in the period 1969-73. Fry and White have delivered a follow-up survey of libraries to NSF, which shows a con­tinuance in 1974-76 of the earlier trend.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=FNRef>1</span></a> <sup> </sup>As for publishers, subscription levels showed a generally upward trend, but not all publishers were in sound financial condition. While com­mercial publishers had adequate returns, society publishers had small but positive margins, and many university presses were operating at in-creasing deficits. It was this part of the original Indiana University study on which the survey by CONTU builds.</p>

<a name="sec5.2."></a>
<h2>The Survey</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The survey had a two-fold purpose. First, it aimed to discover the extent to which publishers of U.S. scholarly, scientific, and technical journals currently provide copies of back articles or issues, or else make provision for authorized reproduction, either directly or by means of an agent. Second, the survey attempted to gauge the willingness of publishers to participate in some sort of national clearinghouse mechanism for the authorizing of reproduction and the collection and distribution of fees. A subject of particular interest was the amount of payment that publishers would expect to receive for authorization to make copies.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Indiana University researchers updated the master list of publishers and journals used in the earlier survey. The final list included almost 1,700 publishers of about 2,500 journals.  More than 500 publishers filled out question­naires covering almost 1,000 journals. The over­whelming majority of these publishers are small: 450 of them publish only one journal. Further­more, most of the journals are small: more than one-half have fewer than 3,000 subscriptions. While 90 percent of the responding journals had registered for copyright, only 60 percent of the journals which did not respond had registered. The questionnaires were mailed out in February 1977, and the cutoff date for <span class=SourcePN>{Page 131}</span> re­plies was in May 1977. Thus, the new law was not yet in effect, and plans for the Copyright Clearance Center, Inc. (CCC) were still only in the formulative stage and not widely known. These considerations affect the interpretation of some of the responses.</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<a name="sec5.3.1."></a>
<h3>Journals and Fees</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>At the time of the survey, more than one-half of the responding journals sold reprints directly and about one-third through an agent; the two dominant agents used are Xerox University Microfilms and Information Unlimited. A typi­cal charge for a reprint of a ten-page article was five dollars. Journals which did not then sell reprints said they hypothetically would be will­ing to settle for a lesser fee. Two-thirds of the journals generated less than 6 reprint orders a week; at the other extreme, 13 percent gen­erated 150 or more each week. About one-half of the journals said they filled orders within five days.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>One-half of the copyrighted journals expected no royalty payments from any participation in a national clearinghouse. A majority of the remainder would have accepted a fifty-cent payment, but a small minority held out for five dollars or more. As for microform editions, journals preferred to sell them through an agent rather than directly. In addition, they were largely unwilling to permit unrestricted copying from microforms, either of current or back issues. Willingness to permit copying from paper issues was also low, except for copying of back issues by nonprofit organizations. Most publishers not then supplying reprints or photocopies expressed an unwillingness to do so in the future.</p>

<a name="sec5.3.2."></a>
<h3>Publishers and Services</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>The results of the survey may be stated also by characterizing publishers rather than journals. Publishers preferred to license reproduction and supply reprints directly as opposed to delegating those functions to a clearinghouse. A large majority of publishers was willing to accept telephone orders, but few saw merit in other modes of telecommunication. Similarly, publishers preferred payment with each order and disliked open or deposit accounts.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The time at which this survey was conducted needs to be considered in assessing the results. Since the plans for CCC were only in the formu­lation stage and not widely known, the hypo­thetical questions concerning participation in a clearinghouse had an abstract character, and the responses may not necessarily indicate the level of willingness to participate in CCC or other actual body. In addition, it should be remem­bered that the bulk of the respondents publish only one journal and do not have a sophisticated knowledge of the workings of copyright. This helps to account for the lack of expectation of revenues from copying fees and fear of organizational encumbrance from a clearinghouse; it may also explain the unreasonably high fees expected by some. Those high expectations may also be interpreted as restating an unwillingness to participate or as reflecting a desire to main­tain circulation by making copying very expen­sive.</p>

<p class=Chapter><i>Final Report of the National Commission on New
Technology Uses of Copyrighted Works</i>
</p>
<hr>

<p class=Chapter>Chapter 4 – Machine Reproduction – Photocopying</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The National Commission on New Tech­nological Uses of Copyrighted Works was created by Congress, in part, to assist it in re­solving a problem that had proven especially difficult in the revision of the 1909 Copyright Act: drawing a proper balance between the rights of copyright owners, whose works were easily reproduced through the use of advanced reproduction technologies, and the general in­terests and needs of members of the public, who more and more were relying on photocopying as an important auxiliary form of access to copyrighted works. According to the legislation that authorized its establishment, the Commis­sion was required to study and compile data on:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(1) the reproduction and use of copyrighted works of authorship . . .</p>

<p class=DblBlockQuote>(B) by various forms of machine reproduc­tion, not including reproduction by or at the request of instructors for use in face-to-face teaching activities.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=FNRef>191</span></a> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Commission was also charged with making recommendations “as to such changes in copy­right law or procedures that may be necessary to assure . . . access to copyrighted works, and to provide recognition of the rights of copyright owners.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=FNRef>192</span></a> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>Because Congress was actively considering photocopying in connection with the general revision bill at the time the Commission began its deliberations, the Commissioners decided at their second meeting to defer hearing witnesses on photocopying issues until Congress finally agreed upon the provisions of the general revi­sion bill directly related to that subject. Chair­man Fuld, however, appointed three members of the Commission to prepare an initial report on the issues related to photocopying that was considered at the December 1975 meeting.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Commission sponsored a number of studies to gather data on photocopying.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=FNRef>193</span></a> Funds were contributed for a study conducted by King Research, Inc., designed to provide data on how much photocopying of copyrighted works ac­tually occurred in libraries throughout the country.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=FNRef>194</span></a> The Public Research Institute pre­pared a study that compared the costs of subscribing and storing periodicals with the costs of borrowing to fulfill patron requests.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=FNRef>195</span></a> The Indiana University Graduate Library School con­ducted a survey of publishers of periodical lit­erature.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=FNRef>196</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>During the year in which these studies were conducted, the Commission heard testimony <span class=SourcePN>{Page 48}</span> from representatives of authors, publishers, libraries, government agencies, educators, and others concerning current and future photo­copying practices and their views on whether the 1976 Act needed amendment. Also during that year, the Commission assisted representa­tives of publisher, author, librarian, and educa­tor groups in formulating guidelines defining which interlibrary loan practices would comport with the provisions of section 108(g) (2) of the new copyright law prohibiting libraries from engaging in “systematic reproduction” of copyrighted works.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=FNRef>197</span></a> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>This report sets forth the Commission’s rec­ommendation to Congress for legislative action and its suggestions to the interested parties for possible adjustments in practices related to photocopying and document delivery. After presenting this recommendation and these sug­gestions, this report discusses the effect of the new copyright law on a broad range of photo­copying practices and reviews the evidence that the Commission considered in reaching its con­clusions.</p>

<h1>Recommendations of the Commission</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>The Commission’s investigations and the testimony it heard support the determination that, with one exception, the Commission need not recommend changes in the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976 affecting photocopying. The one exception deals with photocopying by organizations that are in the business of making copies. The Commission also suggests certain matters that should be studied by the Register of Copyrights in preparing the first five-year report assessing how effectively the interests of copyright proprietors and users are balanced un­der the photocopying provisions of the new law. Also suggested are certain actions that could be taken voluntarily by other interested parties to facilitate access to copyrighted works in photo­copy form within the framework of the Copy­right Act of 1976.</p>

The term <i>machine reproduction<b> </b></i>in its mandate was recognized as being susceptible to various interpretations. The Commission’s legislative history has clear indications that Congress had contemplated a study of photocopying and re­lated methods of reproduction-rather than videotape reproduction and other emerging technologies-when it created the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission determined to concentrate its efforts on photoduplication and closely related means of reproduction.</p>

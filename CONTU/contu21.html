<p class=Chapter><i>Final Report of the National Commission on New
Technology Uses of Copyrighted Works</i>

<h1>Recommendations to Publishers</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>Publishers, especially publishers of journals, in cooperation<b> </b>with the library community, the Copyright Office, and the Library of Congress, should exert every effort to facilitate the deter­mination of the copyright status of both current and older issues of their publications. A large portion of periodical issues copyrighted under the provisions of the 1909 Act have not been renewed and are in the public domain. In addi­tion, the Fry/White/Johnson study undertaken for the Commission showed that publishers of many scholarly journals are willing to permit libraries – especially nonprofit libraries - to photocopy beyond the limits established by sections 107 and 108 of the 1976 Act.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class=FNRef>209</span></a> </p>

<p class=Paragraph>Publishers might inform the public of the copyright status of journal issues in several ways. Journal publishers could display prominently the copyright notice if they wish to protect their copyright and could include information in their current issues concerning the copyright status of back issues. Whether or not published with a copyright notice, every journal issue could carry a statement of policy with respect to copying. For example, several of the journals published by the American Library Association carry the following statement:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>All material in this journal subject to copyright by the American Library Association may be photocopied for the noncommercial purpose of scientific or educational advancement.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote><span class=SourcePN>{Page 52}</span></p>

<p class=ParaNonIndent>It would be helpful if the Register of Copy­rights and the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) would bring together representatives of journal publishers, authors, and library organizations to work out various forms of standard language providing the type of information suggested.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Every issue of a journal could display promi­nently a statement of participation (or non-participation) in copying clearance arrange­ments, such as the Copyright Clearance Center, Inc. (CCC), and could, in addition, indicate where and at what cost copies of articles or back issues may be obtained. If the publisher permits copying beyond that allowed by the 1976 Act, the publisher should so include that information in the statement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Each issue of a journal should contain the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) assigned by the Serial Records Division of the Library of Congress. This inclusion would fa­cilitate the determination of the copyright status of periodical articles by computerized on-line systems.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=FNRef>210</span></a> Users of copyrighted works will also benefit if organizations that authorize copying for a stated fee, such as CCC, include in their catalogs information on the copyright status of older issues similar to that suggested for incorporation in each journal issue, and informa­tion concerning where and at what cost author­ized copies may be obtained.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=FNRef>211</span></a> </p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20" title=""><span class=FNRef>210</span></a> The Copyright Office registration form TX for periodical issues published after December 31, 1977, includes a place for the insertion of the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). The U.S. Postal Service and the Library of Congress have agreed as a general rule to have the ISSN printed in each issue of second-class publications instead of the separate and different identification number now used by the Postal Service. 43<i>Fed. Reg. </i>29943.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref21" name="_ftn21" title=""><span class=FNRef>211</span></a> The chairman of the Copyright Clearance Cen­ter, in a letter dated April 14, 1978, informed the Commission that the center intended to “request publishers for information on the copyright status of older journals, and include information received in catalogues to be published in the future.”</p>

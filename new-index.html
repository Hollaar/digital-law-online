    The National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) 
    was established by Congress to determine how the Copyright Act of 1976 
    should address computers and copy machines. Chapter 3 of its final report 
    discusses copyright law as applied to computer software and databases. 
    Although frequently cited, this report is not easily available.<p>At 
    present, we are making Chapter 3 available in both
    <a href="CONTU/Chapter3.pdf">searchable PDF</a> (about 4.3 MBytes) and
    <a href="CONTU/Chapter3.htm">HTML</a> forms. Although we have proofread the 
    output of the OCR program, there still may be errors.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the entire report will be available here.</td>

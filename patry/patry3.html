<h1>The Colonies and Copyright</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>The power of education and a free press are well known to autocrats and to the autocracy’s subjects. Sir William Berkeley, Charles I’s royal governor in Virginia, no doubt had this in mind when, in 1671, he remarked: “I thank God there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world, and printing has divulged them, and libels against the best government. God keep us from both.”<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class=FNRef>32</span></a> Whether through God or the Crown, no printing was permitted in Virginia until 1730.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>At the time of Sir William’s pronouncement, there was only one printing establishment in the colonies, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, press of the widow Glover and Matthew Daye, whose 1639 <i>Bay Psalm Book</i> is believed to be the first book printed in the colonies.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class=FNRef>33</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Other colonies besides Virginia were also restrictive. In 1685, King James II instructed Thomas Dongan, the royal governor of New York, not to permit printing without Dongan’s personal permission. The Pennsylvania authorities shut down an effort to establish a printing press that same year, forcing the printer, William Bradford, to move to New York, where presumably he received Dongan’s permission to establish his business.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Given the prevailing environment, it is hardly surprising that printing in the colonies got off to a very slow start, and when permitted at all, was used, on the whole, to further the purposes of Church and State, not the general education of the population. For these reasons, as well as the lack of a substantial <span class=SourcePN>{Page 15}</span> educated class in the colonies, colonial authors typically looked to England for their primary audience. For example, in 1650, the first volume of poetry known to have been written in America, Anne Bradstreet’s <i>The Tenth Muse, Lately Sprung Up in America</i>, was published in London.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class=FNRef>34</span></a> In 1702, Cotton Mather sent his <i>Magnalia Christi Americana</i> to England to be published, not even bothering with a colonial printer.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class=FNRef>35</span></a> There were exceptions, of course, such as Michael Wigglesworth’s best-seller <i>The Day of Doom</i>.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class=FNRef>36</span></a> For the most part, though, colonial printers made their living selling newspapers and writing supplies, and importing British books. Books were distributed locally; printers in one colony, therefore, had little competition from printers in other colonies. Indeed, in some cases, printers entered into agreements not to infringe each others’ books.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class=FNRef>37</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1672, the Massachusetts General Court, the colony’s legislative body, perhaps to save expenses,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class=FNRef>38</span></a> turned to a private printer, John Usher. In order to protect himself against piracy, Usher petitioned the General Court to give him a monopoly for his work, <i>The Book of General Lawes and Liberties</i>. The General Court responded positively on May 15, 1672, by granting him the following printing patent:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>Enacted, That no Printer shall print any more Coppies than are agreed and paid for by the owner of the Coppie or Coppies, nor shall he nor any other reprint or make Sale of any of the same without the said Owner’s consent upon the forfeiture and penalty of treble the whole charges of Printing and paper of the quantity paid for by the owner of the Coppie, to the said owner or his Assigns.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class=FNRef>39</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Usher is said to have been unsatisfied with the 1672 law, and to have petitioned the General Court for more specific legislation. The next year he <span class=SourcePN>{Page 16}</span> reputedly was granted such protection for a period of seven years.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class=FNRef>40</span></a> Almost 100 years after the Usher patent, on November 7, 1770, Williams Billings, a Boston choir master and composer, petitioned the Massachusetts House of Representatives to give him the “exclusive Privilege of selling a Book of Church-Musick, compos’d by himself, for a certain Term of Years.”<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class=FNRef>41</span></a> Billings was ordered to prepare a bill, which he did on November 16, 1770. Because of doubts over Billings’ authorship of the work, the House continued the matter until its next session. On July 14, 1772, after Billings had petitioned the royal governor, the Majesty’s Council, and the House, he was granted the exclusive right to print and sell his work for a period of seven years.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class=FNRef>42</span></a> Despite this legislative success, the royal governor, Thomas Hutchinson, returned the bill to the House without signing it.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=FNRef>43</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 17}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Connecticut (or the revolutionary era) proved to be more hospitable to Andrew Law, a well-known singing master, who complained in October 1781 that he had spent Þbp500 in hard money (not depreciated Continental currency) to publish one of his music books, <i>A Collection of the Best and Most Approved Tunes and Anthems for the Promotion of Psalmody</i>, and would be financially ruined if it were pirated. The Connecticut General Assembly gave him an “exclusive patent” for a period of five years, with a penalty of Þbp500, with the condition that Mr. Law furnish “a sufficient number of copies” to the public “at reasonable prices.”<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=FNRef>44</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The following year, 1782, Noah Webster sought protection of his soon-to-be-released<i>A Grammatical Institute of the English Language</i>.Webster, a Connecticut schoolteacher (and dissatisfied member of the bar) living in New York, composed his “blue-back” speller (the first part of <i>AGrammatical Institute of the English Language</i>), to provide an American textbook for American schools that were, at that time, using <i>Aby-sel-pha</i>,a British speller by Thomas Dilworth.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=FNRef>45</span></a> Beginning in August 1782, Webster unsuccessfully lobbied the legislatures in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Connecticut for general copyright statutes.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 18}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>On January 6, 1783, John Ledyard, the author of <i>A Journal of Captain Cook’s Last Voyage to the Pacific Ocean</i>, petitioned the Connecticut General Assembly for copyright protection. On January 29, 1783, the General Assembly, instead of passing a private bill for Ledyard, passed the first general colonial copyright statute.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class=FNRef>46</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>With the Connecticut statute as precedent, efforts began to get the other colonies to enact similar laws. Joel Barlow played an important role in this effort. Barlow was the author of the poem <i>The Vision of Columbus</i> and had been Minister to France. Barlow wrote to Elias Boudinot, president of the Continental Congress, providing specific examples of piracy as justification for the need for copyright protection.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class=FNRef>47</span></a> Others involved were Jeremy Belknap, a founder of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and Thomas Paine, who is said to have “counted copyright agitation among his many other revolutionary interests.”<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class=FNRef>48</span></a> Paine is unique in the annals of copyright due to his participation <span class=SourcePN>{Page 19}</span> also as a member of the French legislature that passed that country’s 1793 Copyright Act.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class=FNRef>49</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>On January 8, 1783, the Continental Congress received a copy of the Connecticut Copyright Act; two days later, it received a copy of the letter Barlow had written to Boudinot.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class=FNRef>50</span></a> On March 10, 1783, upon the motion of Hugh Williamson of North Carolina that “a committee be appointed to consider the most proper means of cherishing genius and useful arts through the United States by securing to authors or publishers of new books their property in such works,”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class=FNRef>51</span></a> a committee comprised of Williamson, Ralph Izard (South Carolina), and James Madison (Virginia) was appointed.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class=FNRef>52</span></a> The committee issued its report on May 2, 1783, taking a strong natural rights approach to protection:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>The committee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to whom were referred sundry papers and memorials from different persons on the subject of literary property, [are] persuaded that nothing is more properly a man’s own than the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tend to encourage genius.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class=FNRef>53</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Based on the committee’s favorable recommendation, the Continental Congress passed an act<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class=FNRef>54</span></a> that same day, encouraging all states</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>to secure to the authors or publishers of any new books not hitherto printed, being citizens of the United States, and to their executors, administrators, and assigns, the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned, and to their executors, administrators, and assigns, the copy right of such books for another term of time not less than fourteen years, such copy or exclusive right of printing, publishing, and vending the same, to be secured to the original authors, or publishers, their executors, administrators and assigns, by such laws under such restrictions as to the several States may seem proper.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class=FNRef>55</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>These detailed provisions, unfortunately copied from the Statute of Anne, may in hindsight be seen as an indication that the first federal copyright statute <span class=SourcePN>{Page 20}</span> would be retrogressive, relying on the stingy and cumbersome system developed by Parliament to deal with the Stationers’ abuses, rather than a bold new act appropriate to and in the spirit of the new nation.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Massachusetts and Maryland had anticipated the Continental Congress’s action, enacting laws, respectively, on March 17<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class=FNRef>56</span></a> and April 21, 1783.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class=FNRef>57</span></a> The Massachusetts legislators, although basing their law on Connecticut’s, included in their law a number of what today would be called public interest provisions, such as a deposit requirement,<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class=FNRef>58</span></a> and a de facto prohibition on the use of anonymous and pseudonymous designations. The librarian of the University of Cambridge issued certificates of receipt that served as proof of a valid claim. Delaware was the only state that did not pass a copyright law.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class=FNRef>59</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Copyright protection under the colonial statutes was available only to citizens of the United States and only for books or writings that had not been previously published.<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class=FNRef>60</span></a> The most common term of protection was 14 years (derived from the Statute of Anne), and was adopted by Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class=FNRef>61</span></a> Three states (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Virginia) granted a 21-year period, while New Hampshire granted a 20-year period. Again borrowing from the Statute of Anne, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina granted an additional renewal term of 14 years.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The subject matter enumerated in the colonial laws varied, although in practice there may have been little difference. South Carolina protected only “books”; New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia protected “books and pamphlets”; Maryland protected “books and writings”; Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island protected “books, treatises, and other literary works”; and Connecticut and Georgia more expansively protected “books, pamphlets, maps, and charts.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina conditioned protection on filing the title of the book with the Secretary of State; Virginia with the clerk of the council; and Pennsylvania “in the prothonotary’s office” in Philadelphia. Maryland and South Carolina required <span class=SourcePN>{Page 21}</span> registration of the title not as a prerequisite to protection, but to prevent innocent infringement. The laws in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island did not contain provisions on registration.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia law provided for forfeiture of all infringing copies and a fine of double their value. Penalties of 2 pence per printed sheet were assessed in Maryland, but only 1 pence per printed sheet was assessed in South Carolina. Massachusetts and Rhode Island set a minimum fine of Þbp5 and maximum of Þbp3,000. New Hampshire set a minimum of 5Þbp and a maximum of Þbp1,000. Following the Statute of Anne, the Connecticut, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina statutes contained provisions requiring the author to provide a sufficient number of copies at a “reasonable price.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In light of the contrary interpretation of the federal statute taken by the Supreme Court in 1834,<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class=FNRef>62</span></a> it is interesting to note the strong emphasis on the natural rights of authors contained in the colonial laws. Seven of the statutes having preambles expressly refer to such rights;<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class=FNRef>63</span></a> one (New Jersey) referred to “principles of equity.” The New Hampshire preamble is typical:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>As the improvement of knowledge, the progress of civilization, and the advancement of human happiness, greatly depend on the efforts of ingenious persons in the various arts and sciences; as the principal encouragement such persons can have to make great and beneficial exertions of this nature, must consist in the legal security of the fruits of their study and industry to themselves; and as such security is one of the natural rights of all men, there being no property more peculiarly a man’s own than that which is produced by the labour of his mind: Therefore, to encourage the publication of literary productions, honorary and beneficial to the public.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class=FNRef>64</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Few authors, however, took advantage of the colonial statutes. Noah Webster was an exception, and his indefatigable efforts on behalf of his <i>A Grammatical Institute of the English Language</i> during 1785 and 1786 illustrate the practical problems facing an author or publisher under the patchwork of the colonial laws.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class=FNRef>65</span></a> Webster originally granted the publishers Hudson &amp; <span class=SourcePN>{Page 22}</span> Goodwin the exclusive right in all the colonies for the first edition of <i>A Grammatical Institute of the English Language</i>. The contract was then renegotiated, with Hudson &amp; Goodwin retaining exclusive rights for the New England states, but conveying back to Webster the exclusive rights for the remaining states. Webster then sold the rights for Georgia, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina to Samuel Campbell of New York. Campbell had 2,000 copies of the work printed for him by Hudson &amp; Goodwin in Connecticut.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Nathaniel Patten, a Hartford, Connecticut, bookseller, bought 1,500 copies of Webster’s work from Campbell in New York and offered them for sale in Connecticut at a price lower than Hudson &amp; Goodwin’s. Hudson &amp; Goodwin sued Patten in Connecticut for infringement. Patten argued that he had not violated the Connecticut statute since he had acquired lawfully made copies of the book (indeed, they had been printed by Hudson &amp; Goodwin). In 1789, a jury in Hartford County, Connecticut, decided in Hudson &amp; Goodwin’s favor, finding that although the printing occurred in Connecticut, the copies “were for Campbell, and upon his copy right, and to be sold in the state of New-York; it was therefore, the same as though Campbell had printed them, in New-York, on his own right, and the defendant had introduced them [in Connecticut].”<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class=FNRef>66</span></a></p>

Webster, A Collection of Papers on Political, Literary and Moral Subjects 173 (1873) and Gilreath, <i>American Literature, Public Policy, and the Copyright Laws Before 1800, reprinted in Federal Copyright Records</i> 1790-1800 at xv-xxiv (Library of Congress 1987) for accounts of Webster’s efforts to secure copyright protection for his works.</p>

<p class=FNText>       Webster was not, however, apparently beyond appropriating the works of others. He was accused by H.L. Mencken of being “sufficiently convinced of the merits” of Dilworth’s work “to imitate it, even to the extent of lifting whole passages.” <i>See</i> W. Bryson, The Mother Tongue 154 (1990).</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref46" name="_ftn46" title=""><span class=FNRef>46</span></a> All of the colonial statutes are reproduced in Copyright Enactments: Laws Passed in the United States Since 1783 Relating to Copyright, Copyright Office Bulletin No. 3 (Revised)(1973). The Connecticut statute is reproduced <i>id.</i> at 1-3. Connecticut protected the works of authors of the other colonies, provided those colonies passed laws similar to Connecticut’s. Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island also extended reciprocal protection. The Maryland and Pennsylvania statutes had an extra twist on this principle, declaring that their statute did not go into effect unless “all and every of the States” passed similar laws. <i>Id.</i> at 6, 11. Since Delaware did not pass a copyright law, Maryland and Pennsylvania’s copyright laws arguably never went into effect. <i>But cf.</i> Tanselle, <i>Copyright Records and the Bibliographer,</i> 22 Studies in Bibliography 77, 84 (1969) (listing a number of registrations of title under both the Pennsylvania and Maryland statutes). Since Maryland and Pennsylvania passed their laws early on (1783 and 1784, respectively), one might expect they would accept registrations and only later determine, after all the states had had a chance to consider the matter, whether all the states had passed similar laws. Passage of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, with its grant to Congress of the power to provide for a uniform federal statute, and the subsequent enactment of the first federal law on May 31, 1790, rendered Maryland and Pennsylvania’s possible wait-and-see approach moot.</p>

<p class=FNText>       Nine months after the Connecticut statute went into effect, Robert Ross appears to have received retroactive protection under it. <i>See</i> Public Records of the State of Connecticut for the Years 1783 and 1784 at 245-46 (1943). Noah Webster was the first (and perhaps only) person to sue under the statute. <i>See infra</i> text at note 66.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref47" name="_ftn47" title=""><span class=FNRef>47</span></a> Among the examples given were <i>M’Fingal,</i> by John Trumbull of Connecticut, which had been published in unauthorized, cheap editions containing “typographical errors, bad paper, and a mean letter &amp; an uncouth page.” As a result of this experience, Timothy Dwight of Massachusetts was reluctant to publish his work, <i>The Conquest of Canaan,</i> until protection was established.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref65" name="_ftn65" title=""><span class=FNRef>65</span></a> Webster’s activities included an appearance before the Continental Congress in support of the petitions that the Congress recommend adoption of copyright laws to the states. Webster inserted on the verso of the title page of the 1783 edition of his work what may be the first copyright notice in the United States:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>The author, sensible that in works of this kind, many errors will escape the most critical observation, requests his friends to be free in offering him their remarks upon this first edition, and promises to make use of them in correcting errors, supplying defects and retrenching superfluities. The second and third Parts are preparing for the Press, and will be published as soon as they are ready, unless an unfavorable reception of the first should prevent. As the whole will be published under the protection of a law of this State, entitled, “An Act for the encouragement of Literature and Genius,” all printers and Booksellers will take notice of this information, and not incur the penalties of that Statute</p>

<p class=FNText>There is a sad epilogue to Webster’s story: “Like Samuel Johnson, [Webster] was a better lexicographer than a businessman. Instead of insisting on royalties, he sold the right outright and never gained the sort of wealth that his tireless labors merited. After Webster’s death in 1843, two businessmen from Springfield, Massachusetts, Charles and George Merriam, bought the rights to his dictionaries and employed his son-in-law&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to prepare a new volume.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This volume, the first Merriam-Webster dictionary, appeared in 1847 and was an instant success.” W. Bryson, The Mother Tongue 157 (1990).</p>

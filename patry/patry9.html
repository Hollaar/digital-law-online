<h1>Amendments to the 1976 Act</h1>

<a name="sec8.1."></a>
<h2>95th Congress: 1977-1978</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In June 1977, six months before the 1976 Act became generally effective, hearings were held on cable television, an issue that refused to go away.<a href="#_ftn317" name="_ftnref317" title=""><span class=FNRef>317</span></a> <span class=SourcePN>{Page 90}</span> Another issue left unresolved in the 1976 Act, performance rights in sound recordings, was the subject of a hearing in 1978,<a href="#_ftn318" name="_ftnref318" title=""><span class=FNRef>318</span></a> but without legislative success. The first substantive amendment to the Act occurred in November 1978, when Section 201(e) was revised to permit involuntary transfers under the Bankruptcy Act.<a href="#_ftn319" name="_ftnref319" title=""><span class=FNRef>319</span></a></p>

<a name="sec8.2."></a>
<h2>96th Congress: 1979-1980</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In July 1978, the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) issued its final report, recommending several changes in the Copyright Act.<a href="#_ftn320" name="_ftnref320" title=""><span class=FNRef>320</span></a> The House held a brief hearing on the CONTU recommendations in 1980.<a href="#_ftn321" name="_ftnref321" title=""><span class=FNRef>321</span></a> On December 12, 1980, President Carter signed into law a substitute Section 117, adopting a number (but not all) of CONTU’s recommendations.<a href="#_ftn322" name="_ftnref322" title=""><span class=FNRef>322</span></a> Under the revised Section 117, owners of lawful copies of computer programs (as defined for the first time in the amendment) are permitted to make another copy or adaptation of the program “as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine,” or as a backup in the event of inadvertent destruction of the original. Restrictions are placed on transfers of copies or adaptations made under the section.<a href="#_ftn323" name="_ftnref323" title=""><span class=FNRef>323</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>At the same time the CONTU report was being considered by Congress, another new technological issue, protection for the designs of semiconductor chips, was raised in the form of a proposed amendment to the definition of “pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works” to include such works.<a href="#_ftn324" name="_ftnref324" title=""><span class=FNRef>324</span></a> A hearing was held in Northern California’s “Silicon Valley” on April 16, 1979, but it turned into an embarrassment when virtually half the industry opposed protection.<a href="#_ftn325" name="_ftnref325" title=""><span class=FNRef>325</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 91}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The issue of a performance right in sound recordings was the subject of another hearing in 1979,<a href="#_ftn326" name="_ftnref326" title=""><span class=FNRef>326</span></a> as was the question of off-air taping of television programming for educational purposes,<a href="#_ftn327" name="_ftnref327" title=""><span class=FNRef>327</span></a> but without legislative action. An oversight hearing was held on the operation of the Copyright Office and the CRT under the new Act.<a href="#_ftn328" name="_ftnref328" title=""><span class=FNRef>328</span></a></p>

<a name="sec8.3."></a>
<h2>97th Congress: 1981-1982</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The years 1981-1982 saw heightened interest in cable television as the CRT began issuing decisions adjusting the compulsory license rates.<a href="#_ftn329" name="_ftnref329" title=""><span class=FNRef>329</span></a> A cable <span class=SourcePN>{Page 92}</span> reform bill passed the House on September 28, 1982, but died in the Senate.<a href="#_ftn330" name="_ftnref330" title=""><span class=FNRef>330</span></a> Extensive hearings were also held on an issue that dramatically burst on the national scene as a result of the famous <i>Betamax</i> case<a href="#_ftn331" name="_ftnref331" title=""><span class=FNRef>331</span></a>:home off-air videotaping of free broadcast television programming.<a href="#_ftn332" name="_ftnref332" title=""><span class=FNRef>332</span></a> The work-made-for-hire provisions were also examined,<a href="#_ftn333" name="_ftnref333" title=""><span class=FNRef>333</span></a> as was the question of a performance right for sound recordings.<a href="#_ftn334" name="_ftnref334" title=""><span class=FNRef>334</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>A number of legislative efforts succeeded in 1982, however. Congress handed President Reagan his first veto override by extending the manufacturing clause until July 1, 1986<a href="#_ftn335" name="_ftnref335" title=""><span class=FNRef>335</span></a>; an exemption was created for performances of nondramatic literary or musical works by nonprofit veterans’ and fraternal organizations<a href="#_ftn336" name="_ftnref336" title=""><span class=FNRef>336</span></a> ; increased penalties for trafficking in counterfeit labels for phonorecords, motion pictures, and audiovisual works and for criminal infringement <span class=SourcePN>{Page 93}</span> of these works were added<a href="#_ftn337" name="_ftnref337" title=""><span class=FNRef>337</span></a> ; and the Copyright Office was allowed to retain filing fees in cases where applications were submitted but not accepted.<a href="#_ftn338" name="_ftnref338" title=""><span class=FNRef>338</span></a></p>

<a name="sec8.4."></a>
<h2>98th Congress: 1983-1984</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>As the U.S. trade deficit grew, increased emphasis was placed on protecting U.S. intellectual property overseas, because copyrighted and patented works help contribute to a favorable balance of payments. In 1983, during the first session of the 98th Congress, a number of hearings were held on trade issues,<a href="#_ftn339" name="_ftnref339" title=""><span class=FNRef>339</span></a> on increasing American competitiveness through relaxation of the antitrust laws,<a href="#_ftn340" name="_ftnref340" title=""><span class=FNRef>340</span></a> and on the relationship between copyright and new technologies.<a href="#_ftn341" name="_ftnref341" title=""><span class=FNRef>341</span></a> Hearings were also held on home video and audio taping,<a href="#_ftn342" name="_ftnref342" title=""><span class=FNRef>342</span></a> on modifying <span class=SourcePN>{Page 94}</span> the first sale doctrine for audio and video works,<a href="#_ftn343" name="_ftnref343" title=""><span class=FNRef>343</span></a> on the jukebox compulsory license rate,<a href="#_ftn344" name="_ftnref344" title=""><span class=FNRef>344</span></a> and on the cable television compulsory license rates.<a href="#_ftn345" name="_ftnref345" title=""><span class=FNRef>345</span></a> However, because intellectual property legislation is typically passed during the second session of a Congress, these hearings served to lay the groundwork for the second session of the 98th Congress, in 1984. The sole exception to the general rule of second session passage was the enactment of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983, which conditioned duty-free treatment of imports from Caribbean countries on those countries’ respect for the intellectual property rights of U.S. authors.<a href="#_ftn346" name="_ftnref346" title=""><span class=FNRef>346</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>True to form, the second session of the 98th Congress passed a number of bills, although only one amendment was made to the Copyright Act: spurred on by the advent of compact discs, the so-called “first sale” or “exhaustion” doctrine, embodied in Section 109, was revised to prohibit the unauthorized rental, lease, or lending of phonorecords for direct or indirect commercial advantage.<a href="#_ftn347" name="_ftnref347" title=""><span class=FNRef>347</span></a> Reflecting the growing international distribution (and piracy) of works by satellites, the United States ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention <span class=SourcePN>{Page 95}</span> on December 7, 1984.<a href="#_ftn348" name="_ftnref348" title=""><span class=FNRef>348</span></a> Also on the international front, and building on the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983, Congress added requirements for the adequate and effective protection of U.S. intellectual property rights in the renewal of the General System of Preferences,<a href="#_ftn349" name="_ftnref349" title=""><span class=FNRef>349</span></a> and in the International Trade and Investment Act of 1984.<a href="#_ftn350" name="_ftnref350" title=""><span class=FNRef>350</span></a> American competitiveness was also encouraged by relaxing the antitrust laws for joint ventures.<a href="#_ftn351" name="_ftnref351" title=""><span class=FNRef>351</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984,<a href="#_ftn352" name="_ftnref352" title=""><span class=FNRef>352</span></a> the most comprehensive piece of intellectual property legislation passed that year,<a href="#_ftn353" name="_ftnref353" title=""><span class=FNRef>353</span></a> began as a proposed amendment to the Copyright Act, but ended up according <i>sui generis</i> protection to semiconductor “mask works.” Other important changes, discussed in Chapter 16, were accomplished administratively by the CRT through adjustments in the cable compulsory license payments required of jukebox and cable television operators and those making and distributing phonorecords embodying nondramatic musical works. Copyright Office regulations and policy decisions also had an important impact in the area of cable television.</p>

<a name="sec8.5."></a>
<h2>99th Congress: 1985-1986</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1985, the first session of the 99th Congress saw a number of bills introduced and hearings held, but only one (very minor) piece of legislation enacted: a bill granting the Parliamentarian of the Senate copyright in a publication of the Senate rules.<a href="#_ftn354" name="_ftnref354" title=""><span class=FNRef>354</span></a> Perhaps the most important hearings held were <span class=SourcePN>{Page 96}</span> those on possible United States adherence to the Berne Convention<a href="#_ftn355" name="_ftnref355" title=""><span class=FNRef>355</span></a>; others concerned the ever-present cable television issue (including proposals to abolish the CRT),<a href="#_ftn356" name="_ftnref356" title=""><span class=FNRef>356</span></a> home audio recording royalties,<a href="#_ftn357" name="_ftnref357" title=""><span class=FNRef>357</span></a> and an attempt to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Mills Music, Inc. v. Snyder</i>.<a href="#_ftn358" name="_ftnref358" title=""><span class=FNRef>358</span></a> Continued oversight hearings on the relationship between copyright and new technologies, especially those in the broadcast field, were held in the House,<a href="#_ftn359" name="_ftnref359" title=""><span class=FNRef>359</span></a> while the Senate looked into civil and criminal enforcement issues.<a href="#_ftn360" name="_ftnref360" title=""><span class=FNRef>360</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second session of the 99th Congress (like the 98th) only saw one copyright bill become law: H.R. 3108, introduced by Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier to clarify the eligibility of low power television stations for the Section 111 compulsory license, and to eliminate the need for cable systems to file certain statements with the Copyright Office.<a href="#_ftn361" name="_ftnref361" title=""><span class=FNRef>361</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The effectiveness of a congress should not, however, be measured solely by the number of bills passed; the defeat of ill-advised legislation is equally important. The year 1986 was a landmark year in this respect, as proposals to extend the manufacturing clause were defeated,<a href="#_ftn362" name="_ftnref362" title=""><span class=FNRef>362</span></a> and the clause expired on July 1, 1986.</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 97}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The defeat of the manufacturing clause was the result of opposition from U.S. trading partners and intervention by the Administration, which had been persuaded that the very slight possible negative effect on the domestic printing industry from expiration of the provision was more than offset by the international benefits.<a href="#_ftn363" name="_ftnref363" title=""><span class=FNRef>363</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Abolition of the manufacturing clause was necessary if the United States was ever to adhere to the Berne Convention, an issue that was the subject of a one-day hearing in the Senate on April 15, 1986.<a href="#_ftn364" name="_ftnref364" title=""><span class=FNRef>364</span></a> Following this hearing, on June 18, 1986, President Reagan sent the treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent.<a href="#_ftn365" name="_ftnref365" title=""><span class=FNRef>365</span></a> More extensive hearings were held before various subcommittees in both Houses on general trade issues related to intellectual property.<a href="#_ftn366" name="_ftnref366" title=""><span class=FNRef>366</span></a> Hearings were also held on moral rights and resale royalties for visual artists.<a href="#_ftn367" name="_ftnref367" title=""><span class=FNRef>367</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Questions about reception of copyrighted broadcast programs by home satellite dishes, a new technology, arose as well, and, as with Berne adherence, would later bear fruit.<a href="#_ftn368" name="_ftnref368" title=""><span class=FNRef>368</span></a> Finally, and in the same category of ill-advised legislation as extension of the manufacturing clause, efforts to require licensing of the <span class=SourcePN>{Page 98}</span> synchronization right for musical compositions used in television programming were defeated.<a href="#_ftn369" name="_ftnref369" title=""><span class=FNRef>369</span></a></p>

<a name="sec8.6."></a>
<h2>100th Congress: 1987-1988</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>No copyright legislation was passed in 1987.<a href="#_ftn370" name="_ftnref370" title=""><span class=FNRef>370</span></a> Instead, bills were introduced and hearings held in order to provide the framework for further legislative action, including hearings on moral rights for visual artists,<a href="#_ftn371" name="_ftnref371" title=""><span class=FNRef>371</span></a> mandatory licensing of the synchronization right for musical compositions used in television programming,<a href="#_ftn372" name="_ftnref372" title=""><span class=FNRef>372</span></a> computer software rental,<a href="#_ftn373" name="_ftnref373" title=""><span class=FNRef>373</span></a> design legislation,<a href="#_ftn374" name="_ftnref374" title=""><span class=FNRef>374</span></a> and yet another new technology: digital audio tape machines.<a href="#_ftn375" name="_ftnref375" title=""><span class=FNRef>375</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 99}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>An oversight hearing was held on intellectual property and international trade,<a href="#_ftn376" name="_ftnref376" title=""><span class=FNRef>376</span></a> a topic that was also related to the commencement, on June 17, 1987, of deliberations on Berne adherence by the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice.<a href="#_ftn377" name="_ftnref377" title=""><span class=FNRef>377</span></a> These deliberations led to passage, in 1988, of implementing legislation to conform U.S. law to the minimum Berne standards, and to adherence to the Convention on March 1, 1989.</p>

<a name="sec8.6.1."></a>
<h3>The Berne Implementation Act of 1988</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>The Senate held its final hearings on Berne adherence on February 18 and March 3, 1988.<a href="#_ftn378" name="_ftnref378" title=""><span class=FNRef>378</span></a> The Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks marked up and reported a Berne implementation bill on April 13, 1988; the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill the next day,<a href="#_ftn379" name="_ftnref379" title=""><span class=FNRef>379</span></a> but passage was blocked by the placement of a floor hold on the bill by Senator Claiborne Pell at the request of Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. The Librarian, acting on behalf of the Copyright Office, objected to the bill’s proposal to eliminate the Section 411(a) requirement of registration before suit. Meanwhile, the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice resumed hearings on February 9 and 10, 1988.<a href="#_ftn380" name="_ftnref380" title=""><span class=FNRef>380</span></a> On March 10, 1988, the Subcommittee marked up H.R. 1623, its Berne implementation bill. After debate, the Subcommittee approved a substitute amendment. On March 28, 1988, a clean bill, H.R. 4262, reflecting the substitute amendment, was introduced. On April 28, 1988, this bill was considered by the Committee on the Judiciary, and as amended, was approved and favorably reported.<a href="#_ftn381" name="_ftnref381" title=""><span class=FNRef>381</span></a> On July 14, 1988, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported <span class=SourcePN>{Page 100}</span> the treaty.<a href="#_ftn382" name="_ftnref382" title=""><span class=FNRef>382</span></a> On May 10, 1988, the bill passed the House with a vote of 420-0.<a href="#_ftn383" name="_ftnref383" title=""><span class=FNRef>383</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The action then shifted to the Senate, which passed its Berne implementing legislation on October 5, 1988.<a href="#_ftn384" name="_ftnref384" title=""><span class=FNRef>384</span></a> The treaty was ratified the same day. The implementation bill that passed, however, differed in a number of respects from the bill reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 14, the differences reflecting informal agreements between the two Houses, eliminating the need for a conference. In a parliamentary move, the text of the Senate bill, S. 1301, was passed by the Senate as an amendment to the House passed bill, H.R. 4262, giving the legislation a House bill number. The House then took up the Senate passed version of H.R. 4262 on October 17, 1988, passing it unanimously.<a href="#_ftn385" name="_ftnref385" title=""><span class=FNRef>385</span></a> On October 31, 1988, in Beverly Hills, California, President Reagan signed H.R. 4262 into law.<a href="#_ftn386" name="_ftnref386" title=""><span class=FNRef>386</span></a> The legislation and the treaty were effective on March 1, 1989.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The changes made in U.S. law by this legislation are discussed in various chapters of this text, especially Chapter 17; hence, we will only briefly touch on them here. The most significant changes made by the legislation were the following:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>1. Abolition of the mandatory notice requirement for published works.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>2. Abolition of the requirement in Section 205(d) that recordation of transfer of ownership be obtained before the institution of an infringement action.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>3. Establishment of a “two-tier” system for the mandatory requirement in Section 411 that registration be sought before the institution of an infringement action, pursuant to which works whose country of origin is a Berne country other than the United States do not have to comply with Section 411.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>4. Establishment of a voluntary jukebox license as an alternative to the compulsory license.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>5. Doubling of the maximum allowable statutory damages.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In special declarations contained as notes to title 17,<a href="#_ftn387" name="_ftnref387" title=""><span class=FNRef>387</span></a> the legislation makes very clear that the Convention is not self-executing and that, therefore, any rights exist solely in domestic law. This was particularly important in the area of moral rights, which were the subject of separate hearings.<a href="#_ftn388" name="_ftnref388" title=""><span class=FNRef>388</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 101}</span></p>

<a name="sec8.6.2."></a>
<h3>Other Legislation</h3>

<p class=Paragraph>Three unrelated pieces of legislation were passed in 1988: in the first, Congress responded to the scrambling of pay cable signals and the needs of rural Americans by enacting the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988.<a href="#_ftn389" name="_ftnref389" title=""><span class=FNRef>389</span></a> The essence of this lengthy, complicated provision was the establishment, in new Section 119, of a “statutory” (compulsory) license for the secondary transmission of superstations for private viewing by satellite dish owners.<a href="#_ftn390" name="_ftnref390" title=""><span class=FNRef>390</span></a> Retransmission of a network signal was also permitted if the dish owner was unable to receive the signal over-the-air (i.e., lives in an unserved household, called a “white area”).<a href="#_ftn391" name="_ftnref391" title=""><span class=FNRef>391</span></a> The license fee for 1989-1992, set in the statute, required a semiannual payment by the satellite carrier (the middleman)<a href="#_ftn392" name="_ftnref392" title=""><span class=FNRef>392</span></a> of 12 cents per subscriber for each superstation, and 3 cents per subscriber for each network station.<a href="#_ftn393" name="_ftnref393" title=""><span class=FNRef>393</span></a> For 1992-1994, the rate was set by a compulsory arbitration panel at 17.5 cents per subscriber for superstations not subject to syndicated exclusivity protection, 14 cents per subscriber for stations subject to syndicated exclusivity protection, and 6 cents per subscriber for network stations.<a href="#_ftn394" name="_ftnref394" title=""><span class=FNRef>394</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second piece of legislation passed in 1988 was the extension of the ban on commercial rental of records, first enacted in 1984.<a href="#_ftn395" name="_ftnref395" title=""><span class=FNRef>395</span></a> Under the <span class=SourcePN>{Page 102}</span> legislation,<a href="#_ftn396" name="_ftnref396" title=""><span class=FNRef>396</span></a> the ban was extended until October 4, 1997.<a href="#_ftn397" name="_ftnref397" title=""><span class=FNRef>397</span></a> The question of a similar ban on computer programs was the subject of a hearing in the Senate in 1988. This hearing provided the framework for legislation passed in 1990.<a href="#_ftn398" name="_ftnref398" title=""><span class=FNRef>398</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The third piece of legislation touching directly on intellectual property was the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.<a href="#_ftn399" name="_ftnref399" title=""><span class=FNRef>399</span></a> This Act, discussed in Chapter 17,<a href="#_ftn400" name="_ftnref400" title=""><span class=FNRef>400</span></a> sets forth negotiating objectives of the United States including the adequate and effective protection of U.S. intellectual property overseas, as well as a series of steps that the United States Trade Representative must take to ensure such protection is in place.</p>

<a name="sec8.7."></a>
<h2>101st Congress: 1989-1990</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The 101st Congress saw a hodge-podge of legislative activity, with six bills enacted. Two bills were essentially housekeeping measures: (1) Copyright Office fees were doubled effective January 1, 1991, with the basic registration fee set at $20<a href="#_ftn401" name="_ftnref401" title=""><span class=FNRef>401</span></a>; and (2) the number of CRT commissioners was reduced from five to three.<a href="#_ftn402" name="_ftnref402" title=""><span class=FNRef>402</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 103}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>More substantive legislation began with the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, under which states and their instrumentalities (as well as state employees individually) were made expressly liable for money damages for infringement.<a href="#_ftn403" name="_ftnref403" title=""><span class=FNRef>403</span></a> This Act reversed a series of lower court cases<a href="#_ftn404" name="_ftnref404" title=""><span class=FNRef>404</span></a> interpreting the Copyright Act as insufficiently expressing Congress’s desire to abrogate states’ <span class=SourcePN>{Page 104}</span> sovereign immunity, according to the standard established by the Supreme Court’s 1985 decision in <i>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon.</i><a href="#_ftn405" name="_ftnref405" title=""><span class=FNRef>405</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first sale doctrine was also amended to prohibit the commercial rental of software for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage.<a href="#_ftn406" name="_ftnref406" title=""><span class=FNRef>406</span></a> Although <span class=SourcePN>{Page 105}</span> patterned after the Record Rental Act of 1984, there were differences between the two Acts. For example, the exemption for lending of software by noncommercial educational institutions and libraries was broader than that for phonorecords. Additionally, there were a number of provisions tailored to software: (1) electronic audiovisual games (such as Nintendo and Sega) and computer programs as embodied in automobiles, microwave ovens, and other machines may be rented; and (2) the Fourth Circuit’s decision in <i>Red Baron-Franklin Parks, Inc. v. Taito Corp.</i><a href="#_ftn407" name="_ftnref407" title=""><span class=FNRef>407</span></a> (upholding a claim by the copyright owner of an electronic audiovisual game intended for use in coin-operated arcade games that Section 109 does not act as a limitation on the Section 106(4) public performance right) was reversed effective December 1, 1991, to October 1, 1995.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first federal copyright moral rights protection was enacted in the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990.<a href="#_ftn408" name="_ftnref408" title=""><span class=FNRef>408</span></a> This Act represents the Congress’s willingness, in light of adherence to the Berne Convention, to experiment with extending authors’ rights along the lines found in other Berne member countries. At the same time, however, Congress rejected calls for broader moral rights, especially in the film industry.<a href="#_ftn409" name="_ftnref409" title=""><span class=FNRef>409</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Visual Artists Rights Act is limited to a narrowly defined class of works of the visual arts,<a href="#_ftn410" name="_ftnref410" title=""><span class=FNRef>410</span></a> and ironically in light of its roots in our adherence to the Berne Convention, conditions rights upon compliance with two formalities: (1) copies of a work of visual art must be consecutively numbered; and (2) copies of a work of visual art must be either signed by the artist or bear his or her identifying mark.<a href="#_ftn411" name="_ftnref411" title=""><span class=FNRef>411</span></a> The rights granted are contained in new Section <span class=SourcePN>{Page 106}</span> 106A, and include the right to claim authorship of the work; the right to prevent the use of the artist’s name as the author of a work of visual art he or she did not create<a href="#_ftn412" name="_ftnref412" title=""><span class=FNRef>412</span></a>; the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of a work of visual art that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation<a href="#_ftn413" name="_ftnref413" title=""><span class=FNRef>413</span></a>; the right to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of a work of visual art that would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; as well as the right to prevent any destruction of a work of “recognized stature.”<a href="#_ftn414" name="_ftnref414" title=""><span class=FNRef>414</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Exceptions are provided for modifications of works that are the result of the passage of time or the inherent nature of the materials,<a href="#_ftn415" name="_ftnref415" title=""><span class=FNRef>415</span></a> and that are the result of conservation, or of public presentation, including lighting and placement.<a href="#_ftn416" name="_ftnref416" title=""><span class=FNRef>416</span></a> Complicated provisions govern the removal of works of visual art embodied in buildings.<a href="#_ftn417" name="_ftnref417" title=""><span class=FNRef>417</span></a> Rights may be waived, provided the waiver is express, in writing, and specifically identifies the work and the uses to which the waiver applies<a href="#_ftn418" name="_ftnref418" title=""><span class=FNRef>418</span></a>;rights may not be transferred. The term of protection is life of the author, but state laws that provide protection beyond the life of the author are not preempted (although it is unclear whether they are preempted during the author’s life).<a href="#_ftn419" name="_ftnref419" title=""><span class=FNRef>419</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Another offshoot of Berne adherence was the first new category of subject matter since passage of the 1976 Act:<a href="#_ftn420" name="_ftnref420" title=""><span class=FNRef>420</span></a> an “architectural work,”<a href="#_ftn421" name="_ftnref421" title=""><span class=FNRef>421</span></a> the design of a built three-dimensional structure.<a href="#_ftn422" name="_ftnref422" title=""><span class=FNRef>422</span></a> The Act covered structures either lived <span class=SourcePN>{Page 107}</span> in or used by humans, such as houses, office buildings, museums, churches, belvederes, pergolas, gazebos, garden pavilions, as well as works that were difficult to classify, such as the “engineering architecture” of Santiago Calatrava. Bridges, highway overpasses, canals, dams, and pedestrian walkways were excluded.<a href="#_ftn423" name="_ftnref423" title=""><span class=FNRef>423</span></a> Common windows, doors, and other staple building components are also outside the scope of protection in order to avoid tying up basic architectural vocabulary<a href="#_ftn424" name="_ftnref424" title=""><span class=FNRef>424</span></a> (although any individual features that reflect the architect’s creativity may be protected, as well as an original combination of individually unprotectible elements).<a href="#_ftn425" name="_ftnref425" title=""><span class=FNRef>425</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Two special limitations were placed on copyrighted architectural works: (1) an exemption was provided for the making, distributing, or public displaying of two-dimensional reproductions of architectural works located in or ordinarily visible from public places<a href="#_ftn426" name="_ftnref426" title=""><span class=FNRef>426</span></a>;and (2) owners of buildings embodying protected architectural plans could make alterations without the permission of the copyright owner, and may destroy the building.<a href="#_ftn427" name="_ftnref427" title=""><span class=FNRef>427</span></a> Finally, an amendment was made to Section 301 to ensure that state and local landmark, historical preservation, zoning, and building codes are not preempted.<a href="#_ftn428" name="_ftnref428" title=""><span class=FNRef>428</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>As in past Congresses, bills were introduced and hearings held on issues that did not result (at least immediately) in legislation. These included fair use of unpublished works,<a href="#_ftn429" name="_ftnref429" title=""><span class=FNRef>429</span></a> a proposed exemption for the public performance of <span class=SourcePN>{Page 108}</span> videocassettes in hospitals,<a href="#_ftn430" name="_ftnref430" title=""><span class=FNRef>430</span></a> mandatory fees for prevailing plaintiffs who are individuals or small businesses,<a href="#_ftn431" name="_ftnref431" title=""><span class=FNRef>431</span></a> moral rights,<a href="#_ftn432" name="_ftnref432" title=""><span class=FNRef>432</span></a> works made for-hire,<a href="#_ftn433" name="_ftnref433" title=""><span class=FNRef>433</span></a> design protection,<a href="#_ftn434" name="_ftnref434" title=""><span class=FNRef>434</span></a> government ownership of computer software,<a href="#_ftn435" name="_ftnref435" title=""><span class=FNRef>435</span></a> and digital audio home recording.<a href="#_ftn436" name="_ftnref436" title=""><span class=FNRef>436</span></a> Oversight hearings were held on trade and intellectual property,<a href="#_ftn437" name="_ftnref437" title=""><span class=FNRef>437</span></a> and the appropriateness of copyright for computer software.<a href="#_ftn438" name="_ftnref438" title=""><span class=FNRef>438</span></a></p>

<h2>102d Congress: 1991-1992</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>Three copyright bills and a sui generis chapter in title 17, United States Code, were enacted in the 102d Congress.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first copyright bill to pass the 102d Congress, the Copyright Amendments <span class=SourcePN>{Page 109}</span> Act of 1992, had three titles. Title I contained the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992<a href="#_ftn439" name="_ftnref439" title=""><span class=FNRef>439</span></a> and abolished the requirement that works published between 1964 and 1977 (the last year the 1909 Act governed such issues) be renewed in the Copyright Office or fall into the public domain.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Under the Act, works first published between 1964 and 1977 are automatically renewed for the full 48-year term granted in Section 304(a) of the 1976 Act. Renewal applications can still be filed with the Copyright Office (and at any time during the renewed and extended term), with modest incentives provided for renewal.<a href="#_ftn440" name="_ftnref440" title=""><span class=FNRef>440</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Act also clarified in whom the renewal term vests: Where a renewal application is made within the 28th year of the first term, the renewal vests, <span class=SourcePN>{Page 110}</span> on the first day of the 29th year of the copyright, in the person entitled to the renewal according to Section 304(a)(1)(C) at the time the application is made.<a href="#_ftn441" name="_ftnref441" title=""><span class=FNRef>441</span></a> Where no application is made or the claim was not registered, the renewal vests, on the first day of the 29th year of the copyright, in the person entitled to the renewal according to Section 304(a)(1)(C) on the last day of the 28th year.<a href="#_ftn442" name="_ftnref442" title=""><span class=FNRef>442</span></a> The renewal fee was increased to $20, matching original term registrations.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Title II of the Copyright Amendments Act of 1992 abolished the Section 108(i) requirement that the Copyright Office prepare, every five years, a report on the extent to which Section 108, governing library photocopying, had “achieved the intended statutory balancing of the rights of creators, and the needs of users.”<a href="#_ftn443" name="_ftnref443" title=""><span class=FNRef>443</span></a> After two such reports (1983, 1988), the feeling was “enough said.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>After three years of effort, and a number of iterations, the 102d Congress passed the following amendment to the end of Section 107, dealing with fair use of unpublished works: “The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.”<a href="#_ftn444" name="_ftnref444" title=""><span class=FNRef>444</span></a> The legislation was introduced out of misplaced concerns <span class=SourcePN>{Page 111}</span> by some publishers and authors that the Second Circuit’s decisions in <i>Salinger v. Random House, Inc.</i><a href="#_ftn445" name="_ftnref445" title=""><span class=FNRef>445</span></a> and <i>New Era Publications International ApS v. Henry Holt &amp; Co.</i><a href="#_ftn446" name="_ftnref446" title=""><span class=FNRef>446</span></a> would make the publication of biographies and history using unpublished material more difficult by allegedly erecting a per se rule against fair use of unpublished works. Although the Second Circuit’s subsequent decision in <i>Wright v. Warner Books, Inc.</i><a href="#_ftn447" name="_ftnref447" title=""><span class=FNRef>447</span></a> would appear to have addressed these concerns, publishers continued to argue they were inhibited. Rather than overruling previous decisions, the legislation was crafted carefully to remove any per se rule barring fair use of unpublished works. Decisions issued after enactment have followed this purpose.<a href="#_ftn448" name="_ftnref448" title=""><span class=FNRef>448</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The next copyright bill to pass revamped the felony provisions for copyright infringement.<a href="#_ftn449" name="_ftnref449" title=""><span class=FNRef>449</span></a> This bill was introduced on April 13, 1991, as an effort by Senator Hatch to amend the felony provisions of 18 U.S.C. §2319 to include computer programs. At that time, only infringement of audiovisual works and sound recordings could give rise to felony prosecution.<a href="#_ftn450" name="_ftnref450" title=""><span class=FNRef>450</span></a> Senator Hatch’s bill, S. 893, first passed the Senate on July 27, 1991, as part of an omnibus crime package, and then again on June 4, 1992, as a separate bill.<a href="#_ftn451" name="_ftnref451" title=""><span class=FNRef>451</span></a> S. 893 was referred to the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration on June 11, 1992. The Subcommittee held a hearing on August 12, 1992.<a href="#_ftn452" name="_ftnref452" title=""><span class=FNRef>452</span></a> On September 10, 1992, the Subcommittee marked up S. 893 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, the amendment taking <span class=SourcePN>{Page 112}</span> the global approach ultimately enacted. On September 30, 1992, the Judiciary Committee ordered the bill reported to the floor with a substitute to the amendment in the nature of a substitute reported by the Subcommittee, and with an amendment offered by Mr. Campbell limiting felony liability to acts of infringement that occur within a 180-day period.<a href="#_ftn453" name="_ftnref453" title=""><span class=FNRef>453</span></a> The bill passed the House on October 3,<a href="#_ftn454" name="_ftnref454" title=""><span class=FNRef>454</span></a> and the Senate on October 8, 1992.<a href="#_ftn455" name="_ftnref455" title=""><span class=FNRef>455</span></a> President Bush signed the bill into law on October 28, 1992.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The new Act amended 18 U.S.C. §2319 by providing first-time felony penalties for violation of the reproduction and distribution rights for all types of copyrighted works (the misdemeanor provisions, which applied to all the Section 106 rights for all subject matter, were left unchanged). In order for a felony violation to occur, the acts must be committed willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain. The term “willfully” is undefined, but the legislative history indicates the term means knowledge that the conduct was prohibited by law.<a href="#_ftn456" name="_ftnref456" title=""><span class=FNRef>456</span></a> Additionally, at least ten copies with a retail value of more than $2,500 must be reproduced or distributed within a 180-day period.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The most comprehensive intellectual property enacted by the 102d Congress was the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992,<a href="#_ftn457" name="_ftnref457" title=""><span class=FNRef>457</span></a> which added a new <span class=SourcePN>{Page 113}</span> Chapter 10 to title 17. The Act regulates the importation and distribution of digital audio recording devices (e.g., digital audio tape machines, Sony Mini-Disc machines, and Philips Digital Compact Cassette machines). No direct amendments were made to the Copyright Act, but Section 1008 of the legislation prohibits the bringing of copyright infringement suits against consumers for noncommercial copying of both digital and analog recordings, and against manufacturers and distributors of digital and analog audio devices and media for contributory infringement.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Each “digital audio recording device” or “digital audio interface device”<a href="#_ftn458" name="_ftnref458" title=""><span class=FNRef>458</span></a> imported or distributed must conform to the “Serial Copy Management System,”<a href="#_ftn459" name="_ftnref459" title=""><span class=FNRef>459</span></a> or incorporate either a system that has the same functional characteristics as that system or a system that has been certified by the Secretary of Commerce as prohibiting unauthorized serial copying.<a href="#_ftn460" name="_ftnref460" title=""><span class=FNRef>460</span></a> Royalty payments for each digital audio recording device and medium are paid by either the importer or distributor,<a href="#_ftn461" name="_ftnref461" title=""><span class=FNRef>461</span></a> with penalties provided for the failure to pay the prescribed royalties, failure to incorporate a serial copy prevention system, or circumvention of such a system.<a href="#_ftn462" name="_ftnref462" title=""><span class=FNRef>462</span></a> Because violation of the Act does not give rise to an infringement suit, the obligations under the Act should not be described as a compulsory license.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Royalties are divided into two funds, the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works Fund. The Sound Recordings Fund, which receives 66Þs4Þs6Þs2c9 percent of the royalties, distributes 60 percent of its royalties to sound recording companies and 40 percent to featured performers.<a href="#_ftn463" name="_ftnref463" title=""><span class=FNRef>463</span></a> The Musical Works Fund, <span class=SourcePN>{Page 114}</span> which receives 33Þc8 percent of the royalties, distributes 50 percent of its royalties to music publishers and 50 percent to writers.<a href="#_ftn464" name="_ftnref464" title=""><span class=FNRef>464</span></a> Distribution may be made by agreement of the interested parties or, failing agreement, by the Librarian of Congress.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>As with any Congress, a number of bills were introduced in the 102d Congress that did not make the cut. Into this category fall the design protection bill,<a href="#_ftn465" name="_ftnref465" title=""><span class=FNRef>465</span></a> bills to overhaul and eventually phase out the cable compulsory license,<a href="#_ftn466" name="_ftnref466" title=""><span class=FNRef>466</span></a> a bill to prohibit copyright in statutory citation forms and case law pagination,<a href="#_ftn467" name="_ftnref467" title=""><span class=FNRef>467</span></a> a bill on film labeling,<a href="#_ftn468" name="_ftnref468" title=""><span class=FNRef>468</span></a> a bill to permit satellite distributors to sue satellite carriers for unlawful discrimination under the Copyright Act,<a href="#_ftn469" name="_ftnref469" title=""><span class=FNRef>469</span></a> bills to grant developers of anti-copying devices for videocassettes standing to sue under the Copyright Act for circumvention of those devices,<a href="#_ftn470" name="_ftnref470" title=""><span class=FNRef>470</span></a> bills to permit the U.S. government to own and transfer copyright in computer programs developed under cooperative <span class=SourcePN>{Page 115}</span> research and development agreements,<a href="#_ftn471" name="_ftnref471" title=""><span class=FNRef>471</span></a> and, finally, a bill to grant the U.S. government a copyright in the Flag of the United States and to impose criminal penalties for the destruction of copies of the flag.<a href="#_ftn472" name="_ftnref472" title=""><span class=FNRef>472</span></a> Oversight hearings were held on copyright and telecommunication,<a href="#_ftn473" name="_ftnref473" title=""><span class=FNRef>473</span></a> intellectual property and international issues,<a href="#_ftn474" name="_ftnref474" title=""><span class=FNRef>474</span></a> and fast track trade legislation and intellectual property.<a href="#_ftn475" name="_ftnref475" title=""><span class=FNRef>475</span></a></p>

<a name="sec8.9."></a>
<h2>103d Congress: 1993-1994</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The first session of the 103d Congress saw enactment of significant copyright legislation, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993.<a href="#_ftn476" name="_ftnref476" title=""><span class=FNRef>476</span></a> The <span class=SourcePN>{Page 116}</span> “reform” referred to in the title of the bill was, in fact, <i>abolition.</i> Under the legislation, effective December 17, 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT) was abolished and its functions assigned to the Librarian of Congress and ad hoc arbitration panels called “copyright arbitration royalty panels.” Dissatisfaction with the CRT began shortly after its creation, with the chair of <span class=SourcePN>{Page 117}</span> the Tribunal testifying in favor of its abolition in 1981.<a href="#_ftn477" name="_ftnref477" title=""><span class=FNRef>477</span></a> In 1985, two House members introduced bills to abolish the agency.<a href="#_ftn478" name="_ftnref478" title=""><span class=FNRef>478</span></a> Throughout its 15-year history, the CRT suffered, in this author’s opinion, from a lack of qualified commissioners. In its last two years, the Tribunal was racked with internal dissension and an unwillingness of the chair to abide by majority rule.<a href="#_ftn479" name="_ftnref479" title=""><span class=FNRef>479</span></a> The principal reason for the Tribunal’s abolition was its episodic workload.<a href="#_ftn480" name="_ftnref480" title=""><span class=FNRef>480</span></a> Data gathered by the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration amply documented that three<a href="#_ftn481" name="_ftnref481" title=""><span class=FNRef>481</span></a> full-time, highly paid commissioners were not needed.<a href="#_ftn482" name="_ftnref482" title=""><span class=FNRef>482</span></a> The solution, ad hoc panels, was not original. From its inception in the 1969 Senate revision bill<a href="#_ftn483" name="_ftnref483" title=""><span class=FNRef>483</span></a> to the Senate’s passage of revision legislation on February 19, 1976, the CRT was not a permanent body, but instead ad hoc panels comprised of three arbitrators selected by the Register of Copyrights. The change to a permanent body came in reaction to the Supreme Court’s January 1976 decision in <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i><a href="#_ftn484" name="_ftnref484" title=""><span class=FNRef>484</span></a> finding a separation of powers violation in the appointment process for the Federal Election Commission. Since the Register is appointed by the Librarian of Congress and not by the President, fear that a similar violation of the separation of powers would be found was cited as a reason for the switch to a Presidentially appointed tribunal.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act avoids the <i>Buckley</i> problem by having the Librarian of Congress&nbsp;– a Presidential appointee&nbsp;– select the arbitrators.<a href="#_ftn485" name="_ftnref485" title=""><span class=FNRef>485</span></a> Other than repealing the old jukebox compulsory license in Section 116, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 did not make any substantive changes in the compulsory licenses themselves.<a href="#_ftn486" name="_ftnref486" title=""><span class=FNRef>486</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) implementing legislation <span class=SourcePN>{Page 118}</span> contained two copyright provisions.<a href="#_ftn487" name="_ftnref487" title=""><span class=FNRef>487</span></a> The first repeals the 1997 sunset on the Record Rental Act of 1984,<a href="#_ftn488" name="_ftnref488" title=""><span class=FNRef>488</span></a> thereby making Section 109(b) permanent with respect to the rental, lease, or lending of phonorecords for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage.<a href="#_ftn489" name="_ftnref489" title=""><span class=FNRef>489</span></a> The second provision grants retroactive protection to motion pictures first fixed or published in Mexico or Canada (and to works first fixed in or published with such motion pictures) that fell into the public domain because of a failure to comply with the notice requirements of the 1976 Act.<a href="#_ftn490" name="_ftnref490" title=""><span class=FNRef>490</span></a> This protection is conditioned on the copyright owner filing a statement of an intent to have copyright protection restored with the Copyright Office by December 31, 1994.<a href="#_ftn491" name="_ftnref491" title=""><span class=FNRef>491</span></a> If such a statement is filed, nationals or domiciliaries of the United States who made or acquired copies of the motion picture before January 1, 1994, may continue to exploit those copies until January 1996.<a href="#_ftn492" name="_ftnref492" title=""><span class=FNRef>492</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first session of the 103d Congress also saw proposed major legislation; the Copyright Reform Act of 1993.<a href="#_ftn493" name="_ftnref493" title=""><span class=FNRef>493</span></a> Among the many changes proposed by <span class=SourcePN>{Page 119}</span> this legislation are: (1) repeal of the Section 411(a) requirement that authors register their claims with the Copyright Office before instituting infringement actions; (2) repeal of the Section 412 requirement that all authors have registered their works with the Copyright Office before an infringement occurs as a condition of receiving statutory damages and attorney’s fees; (3) a statutory examination standard to be used by the Copyright Office in examining claims is set forth in a revised Section 410(a); (4) an appeals procedure from refusals to register claims to copyright is required in revised Section 410(b); (5) the mandatory deposit provisions of Section 407 were strengthened; (6) the voluntary deposit provisions of Section 408 were liberalized by permitting the Register of Copyrights to determine whether the deposit of descriptive material only or a written obligation to deposit copies at a later date will be sufficient, and by requiring the Register to promulgate broader group registration regulations; and (7) a new short form application is established in Section 409.<a href="#_ftn494" name="_ftnref494" title=""><span class=FNRef>494</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The intent of the Copyright Reform Act is to “eliminate the last significant vestiges of the formality-based approach to United States copyright law,” to assist U.S. trade negotiators “in their efforts to secure adequate and effecive protection for U.S. works overseas” by “eliminating provisions that other countries, reluctant to protect U.S. works, can point to as justification for discrimination against U.S. works,” and “to ensure that domestically, copyright owners will be able to enjoy the remedies that Congress has granted them.”<a href="#_ftn495" name="_ftnref495" title=""><span class=FNRef>495</span></a> The Act also seeks to reign in the Copyright Office, which in recent years had exceeded its authority to examine claims to copyright in an effort to influence the scope of protection given to works by the courts.<a href="#_ftn496" name="_ftnref496" title=""><span class=FNRef>496</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Extension of the Section 119 satellite compulsory license until December 31, 1999, was also proposed along with making available the Section 111 compulsory license to “wireless” cable.<a href="#_ftn497" name="_ftnref497" title=""><span class=FNRef>497</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 120}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>A series of oversight hearings on international issues were held in the House,<a href="#_ftn498" name="_ftnref498" title=""><span class=FNRef>498</span></a> while legislative hearings were held in the House on the licensing practices of ASCAP and BMI,<a href="#_ftn499" name="_ftnref499" title=""><span class=FNRef>499</span></a> and progress was made on providing a digital performance right for sound recordings.<a href="#_ftn500" name="_ftnref500" title=""><span class=FNRef>500</span></a></p>

<p class=FNText>       Efforts to include moral rights provisions in the Berne implementing legislation were spearheaded, beginning in 1987, by the Directors Guild of America, which wished to prohibit the computer color-encoding of black and white motion pictures and other material alterations to films made without the authorization of the principal director and screenwriter. When it became apparent that these efforts would be unsuccessful, the directors sought separate legislation to accomplish their goal. This too proved impossible, and the directors instead settled for one of the silliest pieces of legislation ever to pass Congress: The National Film Preservation Act of 1988, Act of September 27, 1988, Pub. <i>L. </i>No. 100-446 (included in the Interior Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1989), 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 102 Stat. 1774, 1782, <i>renewed by </i>Act of June 26, 1992, Pub.

On July 28, Mr. Kastenmeier introduced a clean bill version of this amendment as H.R. 3045. On October 3, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill. H.R. Rep.

On May 1, 1990, the Senate passed S. 198 with a floor amendment, 136 Cong. Rec. S5533 (daily ed. May 1, 1990) (remarks of Sen. Hatch, explaining amendment). A hearing on H.R. 2740 was held in the House on July 30, 1990. <i>Computer Software Rental: Hearing on H.R. 2740, S. 198 and HR. 5297 Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Administration of Justice of the House Judiciary Comm., </i>101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990). On August 3, 1990, Mr. Kastenmeier, Mr. Synar, and Mr. Moorhead introduced a clean bill version of H.R. 2740 as HR. 5498 (H.R. 5498 had another title extending protection to architectural works). H.R. 5498 was marked up and approved by the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Administration of Justice on September 14, 1990. On September 18, 1990, the Judiciary Committee marked up the bill and ordered it reported to the House with an amendment offered by Mr. Synar, after defeating an amendment offered by Mr. Hyde to delete the so-called “Red Baron” section (17 U.S.C. § 109(e)(1990)). On September 21, the Judiciary Committee reported the bill to the House. H.R. Rep. No. 735, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990). On September 27, 1990, the House passed H.R. 5498 after adding on the floor H.R. 2690, a bill extending moral rights to visual artists. Passage of H.R. 5498 was then vacated, with the House passing in lieu 5. 198 with an amendment substituting the text of H. R. 5498 as just passed by the House, 136 Cong. Rec. H8266 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1990) (remarks of Mr. Kastenmeier). Not to be outdone, on October 16, 1990, the Senate repassed 5. 198 after tacking on provisions on civil RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) reform, antitrust intellectual property reform, abrogation of state sovereign immunity for patent infringement, and sports lottery reform. 136 Cong. Rec. S16302 (daily ed. Oct. 16, 1990). On October 27, 1990, the final day of the session, the Senate passed H.R. 5316, a judicial reform package with the computer software rental provisions attached as title VIII. 136 Cong. Rec. S 17574 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990). The House passed H.R. 5316 the same legislative day, 136 Cong. Rec. 13314 (daily ed. Oct. 27, 1990) (remarks of Mr. Kastenmeier). President Bush signed H.R. 5316 into law on December 1, 1990.</p>

While witnesses generally supported H.R. 3990, a number of suggestions for improvement were made. On August 3, 1990, Mr. Kastenmeier introduced a revised version of H. R. 3990 as title 11 of H.

On the Senate side, Sens. Simon and six co-sponsors introduced S. 1035 on May 9, 1991. 137 Cong. Rec. 55615, 5648-50.

On April 30, 1992, the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration marked up H.R. 4412 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute.

<p class=FNText>       The genesis of this legislation may be traced back to 1986 and is recounted in H.R. Rep. No. 873, Pt. 1, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 9-10 (1992). The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 started out as S. 1623 and H.R. 3204, companion bills introduced respectively by Sen. DeConcini (and numerous cosponsors) on August 1, 1991, 138 Cong. Rec. S11807, 11841-53 (daily ed.) and by Mr. Hughes and Mr. Brooks on August 2, 1991. The Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks held hearings on October 29, 1991. <i>The Audio Home Recording Act of 1991: Hearing on S. 1623 Before the Subcomm. on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks of the Senate Judiciary Comm., </i>102d Cong., 1st Sess. (1991). The Senate Judiciary Committee reported the bill favorably on November 27, 1991, S. Rep. No. 294, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. (1991). The Senate passed the bill on June 17, 1992, with a floor amendment.</p>

<p class=FNText>138 Cong. Rec. S8409-23 (June 17, 1992). On the House side, hearings were held on February 19, 1992. <i>Audio Home Recording Act of 1991: Hearing on H.R. 3204 Before the Subcomm. on Intellectual Properly and Judicial Administration of the House Judiciary Comm., </i>1 02d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration marked up H.R. 3204 on July 31, 1992, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute that dramatically slimmed down the legislation. On August 11, 1992, the House Judiciary Committee favorably reported the Subcommittee amendment in the nature of a substitute. H.R. Rep. No. 873, Pt. 1, 102d Cong., 2d Sess, 9-10 (1992). <i>See also </i>H.R. Rep. No. 873, Pt. 2, 102d Cong., 2d Sess, 9-10 (1992) (Ways &amp; Means Committee); H.R. Rep.

H9029 (Sept. 22, 1992) (an identical bill, H.R. 5982 was introduced the same day, but never acted on). Immediately following passage of H.R. 3204, the text of H.R. 3204 as passed was inserted into S. 1623 and sent back to the Senate, which passed the bill on October 7, 1992, without comment. President Bush signed the bill into law on October 28, 1992.</p>

This Act began as title II of H.R. 897 (Hughes, Frank) and S. 373 (DeConcini, Hatch), introduced on February 16, 1993. <i>See</i> 139 Cong. Rec. E337 (daily ed. House); 139 Cong. Rec. S1618 (daily ed. Senate). (Title I of the bill concerned, <i>inter alia,</i> reforms in the Copyright Office registration process, <i>see infra</i> text at notes 493-96. Hearings were held in the House on March 3 and 4, 1993. <i>Copyright Reform Act of 1993: Hearings on H.R. 897 Before the Subcomm. on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the House Judiciary Comm.,</i> 103d Congress., 1st Sess.(1993). Hearings in the Senate were held on October 5, 1993. <i>Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993: Hearing on S. 1346 Before the Senate Subcomm.on Patents, Copyrights &amp; Trademarks of the Senate Judiciary Comm.,</i> 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993). On August 3, 1993, the CRT portions of the bill (title II) were reintroduced as H.R. 2840 (Hughes, Frank) and S.1346 (DeConcini, Hatch), 139 Cong. Rec. E1961 (daily ed. House); 139Cong. Rec. S10232, S10237-39 (daily ed. Senate). (The only significant differences between H.R. 897/S.373 and H.R. 2840/S. 1346 were in form: H.R. 897/S. 373 revised chapter 8 of title 17 in a manner designed to make that chapter read more clearly. H.R. 2840/S. 1346 took a “cut and bite” approach: i.e., existing chapter 8 of title 17 was left in place and amended only as necessary.) On August 5, 1993, H.R. 2840 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration with a single amendment in the nature of a substitute. This amendment made the following changes to H.R. 2840 as introduced: (1) Instead of having the Register of Copyrights directly responsible for copyright arbitration panels, the Register of Copyrights is to make recommendations to the Librarian of Congress; (2) The Librarian of Congress is given the authority to make any necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings that would be applied by a copyright arbitration royalty panel; (3) Copyright arbitration royalty panels are directed to look at precedent. On October 6, 1993, the full Judiciary Committee marked up H.R. 2840 as amended by the Subcommittee, and approved it with two amendments offered en bloc by Mr. Hughes and reported the bill as amended. H.R. Rep. No. 286, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1993). (The first amendment offered by Mr. Hughes at the full Committee transferred to the Copyright Office any unexpended funds retained by the CRT at the time of its abolition. The second ensured that the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office will be able to deduct 100 percent of their costs in fulfilling their duties under the Act and will be able to fill positions required for those duties.) H.R. 2840 was passed by the House on October 12, 1993. <i>See</i> 139 Cong. Rec. H7698 (daily ed.). The bill was then held at the desk in the Senate. At this point, the House and Senate informally worked together to make an number of additional improvements to the bill. On November 20, 1993, after agreement had been reached, the Senate took up H.R. 2840 as passed by the House, but struck everything after the enacting clause and inserted in lieu the informally agreed on bill. <i>See</i> 139 Cong. Rec. S16835 (daily ed.). The amended bill was virtually identical to H.R. 2840 as passed by the House on October 12, with the exception of a number of changes designed to improve the arbitration process. <i>See</i> 139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. House Nov. 22, 1993) (explanation of Mr. Hughes), notes 217, 218, 220 in Chapter 16.

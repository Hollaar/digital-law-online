<p class=Chapter>Chapter 1 – Introduction</p>
<a name="sec5."></a>
<h1>Statutory Revision</h1>

<p class=Paragraph>Following the 1790 Act, there were omnibus revisions in 1831, 1870, 1909, and 1976. In between each of these general revisions there were amendments to particular provisions, or grants of new subject matter, rights, or remedies. In order to give a flavor of the development of our copyright law, we shall review the various revisions chronologically.</p>

<a name="sec5.1."></a>
<h2>The 1802 Prints and Notice Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>Gradually, new copyrightable subject matter was developed and the scope and term of protection enlarged. In 1802, the 1790 Act was amended to include “historical and other prints,”<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" title=""><span class=FNRef>108</span></a> and to require, for the first time, copyright <span class=SourcePN>{Page 37}</span> owners to include a prescribed notice on every copy of the work distributed to the public.<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" title=""><span class=FNRef>109</span></a> The consequences for failure to affix the required notice were not spelled out; however, in <i>Ewer v. Cox</i>, the court held that failure to comply with the requirement and the prerequisites set forth in the 1790 Act resulted in a lack of protection.<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110" title=""><span class=FNRef>110</span></a> At the same time, affixation of a fraudulent notice <span class=SourcePN>{Page 38}</span> was made punishable by a fine of $100.<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" title=""><span class=FNRef>111</span></a> The penalty for infringement of prints was $1 per infringing print, <i>qui tam</i>.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The 1802 Act was more expansive, or at least more specific, in the scope of protection, than the 1790 Act, declaring it to be an infringement if any print-seller or “other person whatsoever” caused to be “engraved, etched, copied or sold, in the whole or in part, by varying, adding to, or diminishing from the main design&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without the consent of the proprietor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<a name="sec5.2."></a>
<h2>The 1819 Jurisdictional Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1819, original (but not exclusive) jurisdiction over copyright and patent cases was granted to the federal courts,<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" title=""><span class=FNRef>112</span></a> ending an anomaly under which state courts heard federal statutory copyright cases. The federal courts had previously been unable to hear such cases unless diversity of citizenship existed.<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113" title=""><span class=FNRef>113</span></a> This amendment also expressly provided that actions for copyright infringement could be brought in the equity courts, and gave the circuit courts the power to grant injunctions to prevent infringement.</p>

<a name="sec5.3."></a>
<h2>The 1831 General Revision</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1831, the first of what have been four general revisions of the original Copyright Act occurred.<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title=""><span class=FNRef>114</span></a> Principal among the changes made by this revision <span class=SourcePN>{Page 39}</span> were express protection for musical compositions (but without a right of performance)<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" title=""><span class=FNRef>115</span></a> and for all types of cuts and engravings; extension of the original term of copyright from 14 to 28 years (still measured from the date of filing the title in the district court); restriction of ownership of the renewal term of 14 years to the author or his or her widow(er) and/or children (and vesting the renewal in them if the author died during the first term);<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title=""><span class=FNRef>116</span></a> extension of the statute of limitations for actions for damages from one to two years;<a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title=""><span class=FNRef>117</span></a> and elimination of the requirement that for the original term a notice of claim of copyright be published in a newspaper.<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title=""><span class=FNRef>118</span></a> The form of notice required on copies was simplified.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" title=""><span class=FNRef>119</span></a> At the same time, however, the Act for the first time made clear that affixation of notice on all copies was a condition precedent to protection. Deposit copies were to be delivered to the clerk of the district court within three months after publication. The clerk, on at least an annual basis, was required to transmit the copies, along with certified duplicates of the records, to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="sec5.4."></a>
<h2>The 1834 Recordation Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1834, the 1790 Act was amended to permit, for the first time, recordation of assignments of copyright.<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" title=""><span class=FNRef>120</span></a> Although failure to record did not result in loss <span class=SourcePN>{Page 40}</span> of protection, an assignment not recorded within 60 days of the execution was to be “judged fraudulent and void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration without notice.”<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" title=""><span class=FNRef>121</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.5."></a>
<h2>The 1846 Deposit Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1846, the Act was amended to require the deposit of one copy of each published work with the Smithsonian Institution (both the requirement of deposit <i>and</i> the Institution itself were established by the Act) and an additional copy with the Library of Congress.<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" title=""><span class=FNRef>122</span></a> These copies were in addition to those required to be sent to the Secretary of State.<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" title=""><span class=FNRef>123</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The requirement of deposit of those additional copies represented a change in philosophy. Up to this time, deposits were retained by the Secretary of State for preservation purposes only. The deposit requirement for the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institute, on the other hand, was motivated by an apparent desire to further knowledge through having the copies available for use.<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" title=""><span class=FNRef>124</span></a> Copyright deposits eventually became an important source for the development of the collections of the Library of Congress;<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title=""><span class=FNRef>125</span></a> however, the lack <span class=SourcePN>{Page 41}</span> of any enforcement provision in the 1846 Act for failure to deposit with the Smithsonian and the Library, and a court ruling that failure to make these deposits did not invalidate the copyright,<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" title=""><span class=FNRef>126</span></a> provided impediments to fulfillment of the Act’s goals.</p>

<a name="sec5.6."></a>
<h2>The 1855 Postal Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1855, Congress passed legislation permitting the postage-free mailing of the required deposit copies, presumably to encourage compliance with the law.<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" title=""><span class=FNRef>127</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.7."></a>
<h2>The 1856 Public Performance Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1856, the first right of public performance was granted, although it was limited to dramatic compositions.<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" title=""><span class=FNRef>128</span></a> The right was not limited to for-profit performances. Violations of the right were to be “assessed at [a] sum not less than one hundred dollars for the first, and fifty dollars for every subsequent performance, as to the court having cognizance thereof shall appear to be just.” This provision represents the first time minimum statutory damages were included in the federal Copyright Act.<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" title=""><span class=FNRef>129</span></a> The 1856 Act’s greatest effect was, unexpectedly, on the scope of copyright protection, <span class=SourcePN>{Page 42}</span> as the courts expanded infringement findings well beyond the literal words of the dramatic composition.<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title=""><span class=FNRef>130</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.8."></a>
<h2>The 1859 Deposit Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>By an act of 1859, the records and copies of works previously deposited with the State Department were ordered transferred to the Patent Office (at that time a unit of the Interior Department), which then assumed the State Department’s responsibilities.<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title=""><span class=FNRef>131</span></a> At the same time, the law requiring copies to be deposited with the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress was repealed, at the request of the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Joseph Henry, and with the acquiescence of the Librarian of Congress, John Meehan.<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" title=""><span class=FNRef>132</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.9."></a>
<h2>The 1861 Appeals Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1861, appeals to the Supreme Court from all judgments and decrees of circuit courts in copyright and patent cases were provided for “in the same manner and under the same circumstances as is now provided by law in other judgments or decrees of such circuit courts, without regard to the sum or value in controversy in the action.”<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title=""><span class=FNRef>133</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 43}</span></p>

<a name="sec5.10."></a>
<h2>The 1865 Photography and Deposit Amendments</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1865, copyright protection was extended to photographs.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title=""><span class=FNRef>134</span></a> At the same time, however, loss of the exclusive right of publication for all classes of works was provided for in cases where the claimant failed to comply with the reestablished requirement of deposit with the Library of Congress (but not the Smithsonian), if the deposit copy was not provided within one month after a request therefor had been made.<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title=""><span class=FNRef>135</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.11."></a>
<h2>The 1867 Library of Congress Deposit Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1867, upon the complaint of the Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Spofford that publishers were not depositing their works with the Library, a penalty of $25 was added for the failure to deposit works within one month after publication.<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" title=""><span class=FNRef>136</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.12."></a>
<h2>The 1870 General Revision</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1870, the second general revision of the Act occurred.<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" title=""><span class=FNRef>137</span></a> This revision had a dramatic effect on the future of copyright law. First, over the objections <span class=SourcePN>{Page 44}</span> of authors and publishers,<a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" title=""><span class=FNRef>138</span></a> all responsibility for administration of copyright matters was transferred to and centralized in the Library of Congress. The Librarian established a small “Copyright Department” to aid him in discharging this responsibility (which grew as the number of claims increased, until, in 1897, a Register of Copyrights was appointed).<a href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139" title=""><span class=FNRef>139</span></a> Second, the scope of protected <span class=SourcePN>{Page 45}</span> subject matter and rights accorded existing subject matter were greatly expanded. Paintings,<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" title=""><span class=FNRef>140</span></a> drawings, chromolithographs, statues and statuaries, and “models or designs intended to be perfected as works of fine art” were protected for the first time. Damages for infringement of these works were set at $10 per copy. At the same time, a right of translation was provided,<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" title=""><span class=FNRef>141</span></a> and the right of dramatization was extended to all works.<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title=""><span class=FNRef>142</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The deposit requirement was increased to two copies,<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title=""><span class=FNRef>143</span></a> the time for deposit was reduced from 1 month to 10 days after publication, and it was provided that “no person shall be entitled to a copyright” unless the deposit requirement was met. Compliance with the notice requirement was somewhat softened: rather than being a precondition to protection, compliance was a prerequisite only to the maintenance of an infringement action.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Centralizing copyright administration in the Library of Congress had the <span class=SourcePN>{Page 46}</span> effect of dramatically increasing the number of registrations.<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" title=""><span class=FNRef>144</span></a> In the December 1, 1870, annual report to Congress, Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Spofford stated that “upward of five thousand copyrights have been recorded in the [Librarian’s] Office during less than six months operation of the law.” Mr. Spofford went on to complain that he had been “obliged to employ two of the Library force constantly upon the business of recording copyrights and preparing certificates of the same, besides devoting more than half of my own time to the prompt dispatch of the business involved.”<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" title=""><span class=FNRef>145</span></a> A request for increased funds for additional personnel followed.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>1871, the first full year under the new Act, saw a substantial increase in the number of works received, to more than 19,000, with the Librarian of Congress stating that the centralization “appears to give uniform satisfaction to the authors and publishers of the country.”<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" title=""><span class=FNRef>146</span></a> The number of works submitted in 1872 increased to more than 22,000, many of which were commercial labels. The 1872 annual report of the Librarian to Congress, accordingly, contained a plea that “mere printed labels” should be protected by the Patent Office as trademarks or “designs for labels.” The Librarian took the position that without pictorial embellishment, such labels were not the “writings of authors” within the meaning of the Constitution. The Librarian proposed, therefore, that the Act be amended to exclude “all prints, cuts, or engravings which are intended to be used upon any article of manufacture (except books).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" title=""><span class=FNRef>147</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.13."></a>
<h2>The 1873 Jurisdictional Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1873, the federal courts were finally given exclusive jurisdiction over copyright cases. This Act was otherwise a reenactment of the 1870 Act.<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title=""><span class=FNRef>148</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.14."></a>
<h2>The 1874 Print and Notice Amendments</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1874, the notice provision, which had required the designation “Entered according to act of Congress, in the year ____ by ____, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington” to be affixed to all published <span class=SourcePN>{Page 47}</span> copies, was amended to permit, as an alternative, the affixation of the word “Copyright” together with the year in which the title was registered and the name of the author.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Acting on the Librarian’s request, Congress also amended the statute by providing:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>[I]n the construction of this act, the words “Engraving,” “cut” and “print” shall be applied only to pictorial illustrations or works connected with the fine arts, and no prints or labels designed for use for any other articles of manufacture shall be entered under the copyright laws, but may be registered in the Patent Office.<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" title=""><span class=FNRef>149</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>By virtue of this provision, the Patent Office began issuing certificates of <i>copyright</i> for prints and labels designed for use with manufactured goods, a procedure that continued until 1940.</p>

<a name="sec5.15."></a>
<h2>The 1879 Post Office Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In the Post Office Appropriations Act for 1879, a provision was included that arguably made unlawful the “transmission through the mails of any publication which violates any copyright.”<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title=""><span class=FNRef>150</span></a> The purpose of this provision was to permit foreign newspapers and periodicals to be mailed second class. The final sentence of the two-sentence section read: “Nothing in this act shall be construed as to allow the transmission through the mails of any publication which violates any copyright granted by the United States.”</p>

<p class=Paragraph>One possible reading of this language (the author submits, the preferable one) is that it reflected Congress’s intention of ensuring that the provision did not inadvertently create a defense to an existing right. Another (but dubious) interpretation is that the Act created a new right, prohibiting the use of the mails for the shipment of infringing articles.<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" title=""><span class=FNRef>151</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.16."></a>
<h2>The 1882 Useful Articles Notice Amendment</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The shifting of responsibility for commercial labels to the Patent Office in the 1874 Act did not reflect a general hostility to copyright in designs incorporated in articles of commerce as is seen in this amendment, which provided for a less restrictive notice for such works:</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 48}</span></p>

<p class=BlockQuote>[M]anufacturers of designs for molded decorative articles, tiles, plaques, or articles of pottery or metal subject to copyright may put the copyright mark prescribed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon the back or bottom of such articles, or in such other place upon them as it has been usual for manufacturers of such articles to employ for the placing of manufacturers, merchants, and trade marks thereon.<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" title=""><span class=FNRef>152</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.17."></a>
<h2>The 1891 International Copyright Act</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>After earlier, unsuccessful attempts in the 1830s, 1850s, and 1860s to extend protection to works of foreign authors,<a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" title=""><span class=FNRef>153</span></a> on March 3, 1891, the so-called International Copyright Act became law.<a href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" title=""><span class=FNRef>154</span></a> Under this Act, protection was available to foreign authors, but only on three conditions: (1) the President, by proclamation, determined that U.S. authors were provided copyright protection in the foreign author’s country on “substantially the same basis” as the country extended protection to the works of its own citizens, or, that the foreign nation was a party to an international agreement that provided for reciprocity and to which the United States could adhere; (2) the foreign author complied with all formalities applicable to works of U.S. authors (e.g., notice and deposit); and (3) foreign authors of books (in <i>all</i> languages) and creators of photographs, chromos, and lithographs had their works either printed from type set “within the limits of the United States” or “from plates made therefrom, or from negatives, or drawings on stone made within the limits of the United States, or transfers made therefrom.”<a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" title=""><span class=FNRef>155</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>This last condition of copyright, known as the manufacturing clause, remained, in amended form, a most unfortunate part of U.S. copyright law until July 1, 1986. The conditioning of copyright protection on local printing was a reactionary return to the monopolistic days of the Stationers Company, <span class=SourcePN>{Page 49}</span> and negated the revolutionary step taken by the Statute of Anne and our 1790 Act: protection of <i>authors</i>,not printers.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In the first few years following passage of the Act, bilateral treaties were entered with Belgium (1891), Chile (1896), Costa Rica (1899), Denmark (1893), France (1891), Germany (1892), Italy (1892), Mexico (1896), Netherlands (1899), Portugal (1893), Spain (1891), Switzerland (1891), and the United Kingdom (1891).<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title=""><span class=FNRef>156</span></a> The effect of protection for foreign authors was felt at the Library of Congress within the first six months after the effective date of the act (July 1, 1891). In the 1891 annual report to Congress, Librarian Spofford complained that the increase in the number of applications had “added very largely to the labors of the copyright office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" title=""><span class=FNRef>157</span></a> He went on to note that the Library’s copyright business involved, at that time:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>correspondence of over 75,000 letters annually, besides recording about 50,000 copyright titles, furnishing certificates under seal of the office to the majority of applicants, crediting, stamping, numbering, and filing away some 60,000 publications deposited as evidence of copyright, furnishing receipts for such deposits, recording multitude of transfers or assignments of copyright, supplying record evidence of entries and deposits to parties requiring them in litigation or otherwise, and producing in thousands of cases of searches, the original copies in the office during any one of the twenty-two years of its existence.<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158" title=""><span class=FNRef>158</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>These activities are strikingly similar to many of those carried out by the Copyright Office today.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>Domestically, the 1891 Act made the following revisions: In yet another retrogressive application of formalities that has so regrettably characterized much of our copyright law, the deposit requirement was reduced from ten days after publication to “not later than” the day of publication, regardless of whether publication occurred in the United States or abroad. To effectively bar the infringing importation of copies, the Librarian of Congress was directed to compile entries of registered titles and to provide copies of these entries to the <span class=SourcePN>{Page 50}</span> Secretary of the Treasury, who was directed to prepare catalogs of the entries and distribute them to customs officials and postmasters of post offices receiving foreign mail. This catalog of copyright entries has evolved into a valuable resource, used for domestic purposes (e.g., checking for ownership, renewals) as well as for customs.</p>

<a name="sec5.18."></a>
<h2>The 1893 Amnesty Act</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In an effort to encourage delinquent authors and publishers to comply with the deposit requirements, Congress passed a law providing that if the deposits were sent in by March 1, 1893, protection would not be forfeited. Unfortunately, the law did not go into effect until March 3, 1893.<a href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" title=""><span class=FNRef>159</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.19."></a>
<h2>The 1895 Government Works and Penalties Amendments</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In 1834, the Supreme Court had held, on public policy grounds, that copyright could not be asserted in the texts of judicial opinions and government edicts.<a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" title=""><span class=FNRef>160</span></a> The Printing Law of 1895, designed to centralize the printing of government documents in the Government Printing Office, contained the first statutory prohibition on copyright in government publications, stating that “no Government publications shall be copyrighted.”<a href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" title=""><span class=FNRef>161</span></a> This provision was passed in anticipation of an attempt, later made in 1900 by the chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing, Representative Richardson, to assert copyright in a compilation, prepared by the Committee in 1895, of messages and papers of the presidents of the United States.<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" title=""><span class=FNRef>162</span></a> After members of Congress complained, the Senate Committee on Printing reviewed the matter, stating an opinion, based in part on the 1895 Printing Law, that copyright should not have been claimed.<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" title=""><span class=FNRef>163</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>A second amendment in 1895, this time to the Copyright Act, was passed in response to complaints by newspapers that they were liable for “expensive and oppressive” penalties for publishing photographs. The penalties for infringement of photographs “made from any object not a work of the fine arts” were limited to not less than $100 nor more than $5,000. For infringement of paintings, drawings, engravings, etchings, prints, models or designs for a work of art, and photographs of works of fine art, the penalty was set at not less <span class=SourcePN>{Page 51}</span> than $250 nor more than $10,000. One half of all penalties recovered went to the United States.<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title=""><span class=FNRef>164</span></a></p>

<a name="sec5.20."></a>
<h2>The 1897 Amendments</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>Three acts were passed in 1897. The first Act granted a right of public performance to musical compositions, as well as including, for the first time, criminal penalties: If an unlawful performance or representation of a dramatic or musical composition was for profit, the defendant was guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to imprisonment for up to one year. Liberal injunctive relief was also provided.<a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title=""><span class=FNRef>165</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The second Act, signed on February 19, 1897, established the position of Register of Copyrights, at an annual salary of $3,000, as part of the legislative branch appropriations bill for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898.<a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166" title=""><span class=FNRef>166</span></a> The <span class=SourcePN>{Page 52}</span> Register was charged with responsibility for the Library’s existing Copyright Department, which was expanded under the Act to 29 clerks, with salaries ranging from $720 to $1,800 per year.<a href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" title=""><span class=FNRef>167</span></a> The first Register, Thorvald Solberg, <span class=SourcePN>{Page 53}</span> took office on July 22, 1897, shortly before the Library of Congress moved from the Capitol to the newly built Jefferson Building, across the street. Mr. Solberg was appointed by John Russell Young, Ainsworth Spofford’s successor as Librarian of Congress, after being interviewed at the White House by President McKinley.<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" title=""><span class=FNRef>168</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Solberg began his service with the Library of Congress on May 1, 1876, as a cataloger. He was employed by the Library’s law department from 1881-1889, although he was not a lawyer. From 1889 to his appointment in 1897, Solberg was employed by the Boston Book Company. Solberg served as Register of Copyrights for 33 years, the longest of any Register, retiring on April 21, 1930.<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title=""><span class=FNRef>169</span></a> He was instrumental in the revision of the Copyright Act in 1909, and was a champion of authors’ rights, as well as being a strong advocate of United States adherence to the Berne Convention.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The third Act passed in 1897 amended the provisions on affixation of a false notice of copyright, so that the previous penalty ($100) was also applied <span class=SourcePN>{Page 54}</span> to anyone who knowingly issued, sold, or imported articles bearing a false notice of copyright. Situations where there was no copyright in the article as well as where the article was owned by someone else were encompassed under the definition of “false.”<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title=""><span class=FNRef>170</span></a></p>

<h2>The Louisiana Purchase Exposition Act of 1904</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The threat of foreign countries to boycott the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition led Congress to pass a special Act, providing a two-year copyright for foreign exhibitors, dated from receipt of the deposit copy in the Copyright Office, which set up a field station in St. Louis to handle the claims.<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171" title=""><span class=FNRef>171</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 55}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The Act established the first <i>ad interim</i> protection: Copyright (for the two-year period) was granted without the need to comply with the manufacturing clause, or, apparently, the notice provision; if, however, the author did comply with the clause’s requirements during the two-year period, protection was extended for the full 42 years provided under the statute (28 years for the original term plus the 14-year renewal term).</p>

<a name="sec5.22."></a>
<h2>The Ad Interim Act of 1905</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In response to threats from France and Germany to repeal their copyright treaties with the United States over the manufacturing clause, Register Solberg recommended a second, general <i>ad interim</i> law.<a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" title=""><span class=FNRef>172</span></a> A bill to this effect was introduced and signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt on March 3, 1905.<a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" title=""><span class=FNRef>173</span></a> The 1905 Act was, however, less generous than the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Act, since it applied only to books in foreign languages, contained a notice requirement,<a href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" title=""><span class=FNRef>174</span></a> and provided for a period of only one year for filing title and depositing a second<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175" title=""><span class=FNRef>175</span></a> set of copies with the Copyright Office.</p>

<a name="sec5.23."></a>
<h2>The Mexico City Convention</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>The first multilateral copyright convention adhered to by the United States was the Mexico City Convention of 1902, proclaimed by President Theodore Roosevelt on April 9, 1908, and effective between the United States, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador on July 1, 1908. This treaty was later superseded by the Buenos Aires Convention in 1914 for all countries except El Salvador. The Convention was entered into without implementing legislation.<a href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" title=""><span class=FNRef>176</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 56}</span></p>

<a name="sec5.24."></a>
<h2>The 1909 Copyright Act</h2>

<p class=Paragraph>In each of his annual reports for the years 1901-1904, Register of Copyrights Solberg called for an omnibus revision and consolidation of the copyright laws.<a href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title=""><span class=FNRef>177</span></a> Toward that goal, he recommended that Congress appoint a commission, comprised of individuals representing the interests affected by copyright, to prepare a draft bill. This procedure had been followed in 1868, and led to the 1870 Act. The Senate Committee on Patents apparently rejected the proposal; instead, the committee asked the Librarian of Congress to convene a series of conferences that would produce a draft bill that could be presented to Congress in 1906.<a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title=""><span class=FNRef>178</span></a> Further impetus for revision was given by President Theodore Roosevelt in a December 5, 1905, message to Congress.<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title=""><span class=FNRef>179</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 57}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Three conferences were held by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office: The first was conducted from May 31-June 2, 1905, in New York City<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title=""><span class=FNRef>180</span></a>; the second, November 1-4, 1905, also in New York City<a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" title=""><span class=FNRef>181</span></a>; the third from March 13-16, 1906, in Washington, D.C.<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182" title=""><span class=FNRef>182</span></a> Before, during, and after these conferences, the Copyright Office prepared memoranda on major issues and carried on an extensive correspondence with the participants. After the first conference, the Office prepared a draft bill that was circulated for comment before the second conference. This draft was then revised, and presented to the third conference.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The first congressional hearings, before the House Committee on Patents on May 2-3, 1906, were held before the introduction of any bills.<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" title=""><span class=FNRef>183</span></a> Following these hearings, a bill was prepared by the Copyright Office and introduced on May 31, 1906, in both Houses as H.R. 19853 and S. 6330, respectively.<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" title=""><span class=FNRef>184</span></a> Joint hearings on H.R. 19853 and S. 6330 were then conducted before the House and Senate Committees on Patents on June 6-9<a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" title=""><span class=FNRef>185</span></a> and December 7, 8, 10, and 11, 1906.<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" title=""><span class=FNRef>186</span></a> Although many witnesses testified in favor of the bills as drafted, two disputed issues arose: (1) the use of copyrighted music on piano rolls<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title=""><span class=FNRef>187</span></a> and phonographs, and (2) importation by public libraries of books printed abroad.<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title=""><span class=FNRef>188</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>In response to opposition to these issues and other parts of the bills, revisions were made and new bills H.R. 25133 and S. 1890 were introduced on January 29, 1907. These bills were favorably reported by the committees shortly after their introduction.<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title=""><span class=FNRef>189</span></a> Opposition continued regarding the grant to music copyright owners of an exclusive right to control the reproduction of their music on mechanical devices, and thus the bills did not pass.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In the 60th Congress, H.R. 25133 and S. 1890 from the 59th Congress <span class=SourcePN>{Page 58}</span> were reintroduced, respectively, on December 2 and 16, 1907, as H.R. 243 and S. 2499. Rival bills reflecting opposition to the mechanical reproduction right were introduced on December 18, 1907, and January 6, 1908, as S. 2900 and H.R. 11794. Joint hearings on these bills were held by the Committees on Patents on March 26-28, 1908,<a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title=""><span class=FNRef>190</span></a> and before a House subcommittee on January 20, 1909.<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title=""><span class=FNRef>191</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Following the conclusion of the hearings, a number of revision bills were introduced. On February 22, 1909, the House Committee on Patents reported, as amended, one of these bills, H.R. 28192.<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" title=""><span class=FNRef>192</span></a> The Senate reported out a similar bill, S. 9440, on March 1, 1909.<a href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" title=""><span class=FNRef>193</span></a> The House passed H.R. 28192 on March 3, 1909; the Senate substituted H.R. 28192 for its own bill, and as substituted, passed H.R. 28192 the same day. On March 4, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt, on his final day in office, signed the bill.<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title=""><span class=FNRef>194</span></a> The Act became effective July 1, 1909.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In drafting the 1909 Act, care was taken to use in the text, as far as possible, words and phrases that had already received judicial construction. In its final form, the Act was a compromise measure, a composite of several tentative bills and proposals embodying different points of view and interests. Changes appear to have been made in one place without the necessary corresponding changes in other places. This resulted in a lack of clarity and coherence in certain sections and caused substantial difficulties in the administration of the Act.<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195" title=""><span class=FNRef>195</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>Some notable improvements over the old law were achieved in the 1909 Act, however, including:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(1) broadening of the subject matter of copyright by an expanded list of protected works,<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196" title=""><span class=FNRef>196</span></a> and by the use of a catch-all clause stating Congress’s intent to protect “all the writings” of an author;</p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 59}</span></p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(2) exempting books in foreign languages and photographs of foreign origin from the manufacturing clause;</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(3) dating copyright in published works from first publication of the work with a proper notice, instead of from the date of filing of the title, which often took place long before the work was ready for publication, combined with provisions preventing forfeiture for accidental omission of notice;</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(4) extending the renewal term by 14 years, thereby bringing the maximum term of protection to 56 years;</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(5) making the certificate of registration prima facie evidence of the facts recorded;<a href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" title=""><span class=FNRef>197</span></a></p>

<p class=BlockQuote>(6) unifying law and equity actions into one proceeding.<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" title=""><span class=FNRef>198</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph>The dispute over mechanical reproduction of musical compositions was resolved by introducing a new concept into U.S. copyright law, the compulsory license. Under Section 1(e) of the Act, copyright owners were granted the exclusive right to authorize the reproduction of their works by mechanical means, subject, however, to the following limitations: After the initial authorized recording of the work had been made, any other person was permitted to make “similar use” of the copyrighted work upon payment to the copyright proprietor of a royalty of two cents “on each part manufactured.”<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" title=""><span class=FNRef>199</span></a> Moreover, notwithstanding that the copyright owner was given the exclusive right to publicly perform a musical composition for profit,<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" title=""><span class=FNRef>200</span></a> “coin-operated machines” (then found in penny arcades) were given an exemption from any liability or payment, unless a fee was charged for admission to the establishment where the machine was located. Additionally, reflecting the Supreme Court’s June 1, 1908, decision in <i>Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus</i>,<a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" title=""><span class=FNRef>201</span></a> Section 41 of the Act<a href="#_ftn202" name="_ftnref202" title=""><span class=FNRef>202</span></a> codified the “first sale” or “exhaustion” doctrine, according to which a lawfully obtained copy may be transferred without the consent of the copyright owner.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In a significant number of respects, however, the 1909 Act failed to make substantial improvements over the previous laws. The formalities of notice,<a href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203" title=""><span class=FNRef>203</span></a> <span class=SourcePN>{Page 60}</span> deposit,<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204" title=""><span class=FNRef>204</span></a> and registration,<a href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205" title=""><span class=FNRef>205</span></a> as well as requirements of American manufacture of English-language books, periodicals, photoengravings, lithographs, and most illustrations embodied in books,<a href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206" title=""><span class=FNRef>206</span></a> were retained and made even more onerous. Further, by excluding federal protection for unpublished works except those designed for exhibition, performance, or oral delivery, the Act took a step backward that was not rectified until the general revision of 1976.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>In terms of international relations, the 1909 Act was also a disappointment. By requiring foreign authors to comply with the notice, deposit, and manufacturing clause requirements, adherence to the Berne Convention was rendered impossible.<a href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207" title=""><span class=FNRef>207</span></a> On the positive side, the 1909 Act: (1) exempted from the manufacturing clause books of foreign origin “in a language or languages other than English”; (2) made explicit that U.S. domicile at the time of first publication satisfied national eligibility requirements; and (3) added a third basis for presidential proclamations (in addition to the national treatment and “open convention” criteria found in the 1891 Act, relations could be established if the foreign country provided protection “substantially equal to the protection secured&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under this Act or by treaty”).<a href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208" title=""><span class=FNRef>208</span></a></p>

<p class=Paragraph><span class=SourcePN>{Page 61}</span></p>

<p class=Paragraph>On balance, the 1909 Act continued the lamentable American tendency of retaining the early-eighteenth-century English formalities long after the English had moved to a more continental approach. By so doing, the United States deliberately stood outside the international copyright community for almost 50 years, hardly benefiting our then increasingly important world role. Even worse, domestically, authors continued to be deprived of their rights for minor departures from the prescribed formalities. It was not until the year before the 200th anniversary of our copyright law that we retreated, and then only partially from this antiquated system.</p>

<p class=Paragraph>The subsequent development of television and other broadcasting techniques, and visual and aural recording, together with changes in business methods and practices, created unexpected challenges. While the courts found the terms of the Act fairly adaptable, there was, predictably, a lack of uniformity in application in particular cases.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref108" name="_ftn108" title=""><span class=FNRef>108</span></a> Act of April 29, 1802, 7th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 Stat. 171. The legislative history of the Act is very brief: On March 24, 1802, Sen. Bradley introduced S. 8. 11 Annals of Congress 202-03, 7th Cong., 1st Sess. (Gales and Seaton’s Register of Debates in Congress). On March 25, the bill was referred to a committee consisting of Sens.Bradley, Morris, and Tracy. <i>Id</i>. at 203. On March 29, the committee reported the bill favorably as amended. <i>Id.</i> at 206. The bill was debated in the Senate on April 1 and 2. <i>Id.</i> at 251. On the latter date, a two-year statute of limitations for false affixation of notice was added, and the bill passed. On April 26 and 27, the House took up the bill, passing it on the latter date without amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 1247 (Apr. 26), 1249 (Apr. 27). President Jefferson signed the bill into law on April 29, 1802.</p>

<p class=FNText>       In Rosenbach v. Dreyfuss, 2 F. 217, 221 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1880), an action under the 1870 Act for imposition of a penalty for false affixation of notice, the court held that the term “print” means “apparently, a picture, something complete in itself, similar in kind to an engraving, cut or photograph.” Use of “and other prints” proved unfortunate, though, as manufacturers sent in thousands of commercial labels for registration, leading the Librarian of Congress to launch an ultimately successful campaign to have responsibility for them shifted to the Patent Office in 1874.</p>

<p class=FNText>       It is interesting to note that §2 of the 1802 Act referred to persons “who shall invent and design, engrave, etch or work” prints, while § 1 referred to persons being the authors of maps, charts, and books. This use of “invent” to refer to the creation of prints continued until the 1909 Act, and raises the issue of whether “authors” always create “writings” and “inventors” always create “discoveries.” The term “invent” to describe the act of creating a print may be traced to the English Engravers’ Act of 1735<i>, </i>8 Geo. II. <i>But cf. </i>R. Godson, A Practical Treatise For Inventions And Of Copyright at v (1823) (discussing creators of inventions as “artists” and creators of literary works as “scholars”). Indeed, the 1802 Act is, in relevant part, copied almost verbatim from the English statute. The English Act was the result of Hogarth’s efforts to prevent the rampant piracy of his works, including <i>Masquerades and Operas, Harlot’s Progress, </i>and <i>The Rake’s Progress. </i>This last work was pirated before Hogarth’s own prints were distributed, the pirates having come to Hogarth’s house to view the work. <i>See</i>Kinzle, <i>Plagiaries-by-Memory of the Rake’s Progress and the Genesis of Hogarth’s Second Picture Story</i>, 29 J. of the Warburg and Courtland Institutes (1966). However, as Stephen Stewart noted, the English Act “protected the engraver but only if he was also the designer simply because Hogarth was both the designer and the engraver of his famous works and it probably did not occur to him that some engravers made engravings from the original work of others. The matter was remedied by the Engraving Copyright Act, 1766 (c. 38).” Stewart, <i>Two Hundred Years of English Copyright Law, reproduced in </i>200 Years of English &amp; American Patent, Trademark and Copyright Law 81, 113 n. 18 (1976). <i>Compare </i>Blackwell</p>

<p class=FNText>v.    Harper, 2 Atk. 93 (1740) (plaintiff who conceived the idea of the print and engraved it could sue) <i>with </i>Jeffreys v. Baldwin, Amb. 164 (1798) (plaintiff who had idea but who neither made drawings of print nor engraved it held not to be a proper claimant).</p>

<p class=FNText>       The issue of authorship in prints was addressed in the United States in Binns v. Woodruff, 3 F. Cas. 421 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1821) (No. 1,424), in which Supreme Court Justice Bushrod Washington, President George Washington’s nephew, held that the statute covered only two situations: (1) where the claimant not only invented and designed the work, but also engraved or etched it; or (2) where the claimant invented or designed the work, but had another do the physical engraving. In the <i>Binns </i>case, “neither the design, nor general arrangement of th[e] print, nor the parts which composed it, were the invention of the plaintiff,” and thus Justice Washington found that plaintiff was not entitled to copyright. 3 F. Cas. at 424.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref109" name="_ftn109" title=""><span class=FNRef>109</span></a> In the case of books and pamphlets, the author was to insert “at full length in the title-page or in the page immediately following the title” a copy of the record that had been reproduced in newspapers. In the case of all other works, the notice read: “Entered according to act of Congress, the day of 18 [here insert the date of the author’s or proprietor’s name and the State in which he resides].”</p>

Of the colonial statutes, only Pennsylvania had a notice requirement. It was clear under this statute that affixation of notice to copies was a prerequisite to protection. <i>See</i> Copyright Enactments: Laws Passed in the United States Since 1783 Relating to Copyright 11 Copyright Office Bulletin No. 3 (Revised)(1973). Commentators have suggested that the federal notice provision grew out of the practice of some publishers of reproducing, on the verso of the title page, the full certificate that the 1790 law required to be inserted in newspapers. <i>SeeRoberts, Records in the Copyright Office Deposited by the United States District Courts Covering the Period</i> 1790-1870 at 7 (1939).</p>

This Act has a very brief legislative history: On January 6, 1819, Senator Otis introduced S. 22. On January 26, the bill was passed by the Senate without amendment. On January 30, the House passed the bill, and President Monroe signed it into law on February 15, 1819.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref114" name="_ftn114" title=""><span class=FNRef>114</span></a> Act of February 3, 1831, 21st Cong., 2d Sess., 4 Stat. 436. The other general revisions occurred in 1870, 1909, and 1976. Work on the 1831 revision began on January 21, 1830, when Mr. Ellsworth introduced H.R. 145 in the House, and it was referred to the Judiciary Committee. On December 17, 1831, the committee reported an amended version of the bill. The Judiciary Committee’s two-page report was the first copyright legislative committee report and was filed by the committee’s chairman, William Ellsworth of Connecticut. 10 Annals of Congress Appendix cxix-cxx, 21st Cong., 2d Sess.(Gale and Seaton’s Register of Debates in Congress). Ellsworth was the son of Oliver Ellsworth, the third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He was also Noah Webster’s son-in-law and later wrote a treatise on copyright law. <i>See</i> W. Ellsworth, A Copy-Right Manual (Boston 1862). In his treatise, Ellsworth stated that the extension of the term from 14 to 28 years in the 1831 Act was done at Webster’s request, <i>id.</i> at 21-22. On January 6, 1831, the House amended the bill to grant to the authors’ heirs, executors, and administrators the benefit of the extended original term of 28 years provided under the Act. On this same date, the House defeated a proposed amendment by Mr. Hoffman to reduce that term to the 14 years provided under the 1790 Act. <i>See</i> 10 Annals of Congress cols. 422-24, 21st Cong., 2d Sess.(Gale and Seaton’s Register of Debates in Congress), and further discussion in Chapter 6, text at notes 23-26. On January 10, 1831, the bill passed the House. On January 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee (by Daniel Webster) reported the bill without amendment. On January 29, the Senate passed the bill, and on February 3, 1831, President Jackson signed it into law.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref115" name="_ftn115" title=""><span class=FNRef>115</span></a> Before this Act, musical compositions had been protected as “books.” <i>See</i> <i>supra</i> note 91.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref116" name="_ftn116" title=""><span class=FNRef>116</span></a> This was not a minor change. Under the 1790 Act, if the author died during the original term, the work went into the public domain at the end of that term, regardless of whether the author had heirs. The 1831 Act changed this by ensuring that the author’s surviving spouse and children received the renewal term under such circumstances. <i>See</i> Chapter 6, text at notes 27-31.</p>

<p class=FNText>       Two questions left unanswered by the 1831 Act were whether the author had the right by <i>inter vivos</i> transfer, to convey, during the first term rights in the renewal term, and whether the author could, by bequest, convey renewal rights to anyone other than the surviving spouse and children. For a discussion of these questions, <i>see</i> Chapter 6, text at notes 32-34, 53-62.</p>

Its origins as a “national library,” dedicated to the broader dissemination of knowledge, is frequently traced to the 1815 purchase of Thomas Jefferson’s personal library of 6,487 books at a price of $23,950 to replace the 3,000 volume library destroyed when the British burned the Capitol on August 25, 1814. Nevertheless, due to congressional opposition, it did not become a “national library” until the tenure of Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Spofford.Spofford was particularly aggressive in his use of the copyright deposit requirement to enrich the Library’s collections, and was responsible for the restoration of the Library deposit requirement in his third month in office, March 1865, six years after the 1859 Act had abolished the requirement. <i>See</i> John Cole, AinsworthSpofford and the “National Library” (1971) 96-102 (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, George Washington University (Washington, D.C.)) and note 132, <i>infra.</i></p>

In addition to carrying on an extensive correspondence with publishers, he also made trips to the federal district courts in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston to check their copyright records. As a result of lobbying by the Patent Office, the requirement of transmitting a deposit copy to the Patent Office remained, despite Spofford’s attempt to have the requirement repealed. The appointment of Samuel S. Fisher, a Cincinnati friend of Spofford’s, as Commissioner of Patents on April 26, 1869, changed the political climate, with the result that administration of all copyright matters was centralized in the Library of Congress in 1870. <i>See</i> <i>infra</i> text at notes 137-47.</p>

Thomas A. Jenckes of Rhode Island, chairman of the Committee on Patents, and Commissioner of Patents Samuel S. Fisher, had the general copyright revision attached as an amendment to H.R. 1714, a bill to reform the patent laws. <i>See</i> 43 Cong. Globe 2683-84, 41st Cong., 2d Sess.

<p class=FNText>       The constitutionality of this Act was challenged 27 years later, when the position of Register of Copyrights was created. The basis for the challenge was a provision in the 1870 law placing the Librarian’s actions (including the granting or denial of copyrights) under the supervision of Congress’s Joint Committee on the Library. <i>See</i>28 Cong.

Given this opposition, it appears that the principal motivation for centralization was not simplification of procedures for applicants, but rather enrichment of the collections of the Library of Congress. <i>See</i> 1897 Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress at 12: “[The 1870 Act] assured the Library a complete collection of American publications.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Under the Act, the entire collection of 23,070 books previously deposited with the State Department was transferred to the Library of Congress. As late as 1897, the Library had not been able, due to inadequate staffing levels, to assimilate all the material it received pursuant to the 1870 Copyright Act. <i>See id.</i> at 5: “The copyright&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. material [is still] lying in indiscriminate heaps on the Library floors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” An earlier bill, introduced in 1862 to centralize the administration of copyright matters in the Patent Office, had been successfully opposed by “publishers, artists, and others.” <i>See</i> Journal of the Senate, 37th Cong., 2d Sess. 468 (May 12, 1862).</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref140" name="_ftn140" title=""><span class=FNRef>140</span></a> On March 23, 1824, during the first session of the 18th Congress, Sen. Lowrie of Pennsylvania, at the request of Rembrandt Peale introduced S. 77, a bill to extend copyright to paintings. 41 Annals of Congress 418 (Gales and Seaton’s Register of Debates in Congress). Peale wanted to protect his famous equestrian portrait of President Washington. Peale said he was willing to sell the painting to the Congress only if he could “have the same privilege of profiting by his work as writers of books have in theirs.” 41 Annals of Congress 511 (Apr. 12, 1824). On March 30 the bill was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. On April 12, S. 77 was debated and defeated on the Senate floor. <i>Id.</i> at 446. In opposing protection for paintings, Sen. Mills of Massachusetts remarked, “had such an act been in existence before Mr. Peale executed his painting, he could not have completed it, as Stuart had previously executed a portrait of Washington, from which Mr. Peale’s was but a copy, with some little embellishment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [S]uch an act of Congress would have a great tendency to retard the progress of the art of painting, as it would do away with the right of imitating, and attempting to excel paintings already in existence.” One of Stuart’s engravings of Washington, the portrait found on the $1 bill, is perhaps the most widely distributed work of art in this country.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref142" name="_ftn142" title=""><span class=FNRef>142</span></a> The statute used the expression “authors may reserve the right to dramatize or to translate their own works,” leading to ambiguity regarding whether authors had to affirmatively state such a reservation of rights. The legend “All rights reserved” stems from an 1874 Library of Congress regulation promulgated under the 1870 Act, advising authors to use the legend (or “Right of Translation Reserved”) below the copyright notice. A written statement to this effect could also be filed with the Library. When the 1891 Act replaced the phrase “may reserve the right to translate or dramatize” with “shall have the exclusive right to dramatize or translate any of their works,” the Library’s regulations were amended in 1893 to state that an affirmative reservation of rights was no longer required.

The Senate passed the bill as amended on May 20. 28 Cong. Rec. 5464. On December 7, the House Committee on Patents reported S. 2306 without amendment. H.R. Rep.

The bill was passed the same day by the House after amendments to exempt charitable or benevolent performances and to imply consent to a public performance from the sale of sheet music or a printed copy of a dramatic composition were defeated after spirited debate. These debates also contain a substantial discussion of the need for injunctive relief, criminal penalties, and mandatory minimum statutory damages. <i>See</i> 29 Cong. Rec. 85-91 (Dec. 10, 1897).

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref166" name="_ftn166" title=""><span class=FNRef>166</span></a> Act of February 19, 1897, 54th Cong., 2d Sess., 29 Stat. 545. The Librarian of Congress had requested that the Library be relieved of all copyright responsibilities, and protested (to no avail) the legislation’s creation of a Copyright Office in the Library. <i>See</i> 29 Cong. Rec. 385 (Dec. 21, 1896) (remarks of Mr. Cummings). Bills introduced in the first session of the 54th Congress provided for the Register to be selected by Congress’s Joint Committee on the Library of Congress, rather than by the Librarian. <i>See</i> S. 425, 54th Cong., 1st Sess. (Dec. 5, 1895) (Morrill), 27 Cong. Rec. 38; H.R. 1243, 54th Cong., 1st Sess. (Dec. 10, 1895) (Bankhead), 27 Cong. Rec. 127. S. 425 was reported by the Committee on the Library on February 20, 1896. 28 Cong. Rec. 1959. On May 8, 1896, S. 425 was brought up on the floor of the Senate, but passed over because it would occasion “discussion,” a prescient observation. 28 Cong. Rec. 4695, 54th Cong., 2d Sess.The bill was then attached to a conference report on an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 9643), over the objections of the House, which considered the appointment provision unconstitutional. <i>See</i> 29 Cong. Rec. 316, 54th Cong., 2dSess. (Dec. 19, 1896) (remarks of Mr. Quigg). On May 21, 1896, the conference report was taken up by the Senate, and a heated floor debate challenging the constitutionality and wisdom of the provision regarding the Register’s selection took place, with the result that the conference report was disapproved. <i>See</i> 28 Cong. Rec. 5496-5507 (May 21, 1896). On December 19 and 21, 1896, the issue of the Register’s selection by the Joint Committee on the Library was debated in the House. <i>See</i> 29 Cong. Rec. 316-17 (Dec. 19, 1896) (House), 29 Cong. Rec. 378, 379 (Dec. 21, 1896) (House). On December 21, Mr. Fairchild proposed, apparently in jest, that the Register be appointed by the Committee on Patents. 29 Cong. Rec. 387-88, 390. The amendment was rejected. On January 20, 1897, an amendment was offered in the Senate by the Appropriations Committee to have the Register appointed by the Librarian, and the Senate agreed to it the same day. 30 Cong. Rec. 975, 54th Cong., 2d Sess. (Jan. 20, 1897). The Senate agreed to the conference report (and referred to the Register’s appointment by the Librarian) on February 15, 1897. <i>See</i> 30 Cong. Rec. 1832-33. The House agreed to the conference report on February 17. <i>See</i> 30 Cong. Rec. 1945-47 (Feb. 17, 1897) (remarks of Mr. Dockery: “We have yielded to the Senate in the matter of confirmation, and in my opinion the House conferees were fully justified in this action. The bill as now agreed upon requires the incoming President on or after the 1st July next to appoint, subject to confirmation by the Senate, a Librarian who shall conduct the operations of the Library in the magnificent new Library building.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sincerely hope that the President-elect will select some one for Librarian solely with reference to his fitness to discharge the duties of that great office”).</p>

<p class=FNText>       This bill also changed the way the Librarian of Congress was appointed. See 30 CONG. REc. 1947 (Feb. 17, 1897). In 1800 the Library was established under the direction of the clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate. In 1802, the law was amended, with a Librarian appointed by the President. President Jefferson, however, appointed Representative John Beckley, who also served as the clerk of the House of Representatives, as Librarian at a salary of $2 per day. In 1807, Patrick Magruder was appointed clerk of the House and also served as Librarian and it was not until 1815 that President Madison appointed a Librarian who was not a member of Congress. George Watterston, who served until 1829, was removed by President Jackson, apparently for writing editorials critical of Jackson. John F. Meehan was appointed by Jackson in 1829 and served until 1861, when President Lincoln terminated his employment and appointed John G. Stephenson, a physician. Stephenson was fired in 1864 for shortchanging booksellers, for dubious bookkeeping practices, and for engaging in war speculation. Lincoln then appointed Ainsworth Spofford in 1861. The 1897 Act required that the Librarian be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The result, if not the purpose, of this change was to permit the new Administration to replace Spofford. In the 1896 election, Grover Cleveland had lost to William McKinley. After passage of the 1897 Act, President McKinley fired Spofford and replaced him with John Russell Young, a newspaperman. Young died 18 months later in 1899. McKinley then appointed 38-year-old Herbert Putnam, the librarian of Boston Public Library, who served 56 years.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref167" name="_ftn167" title=""><span class=FNRef>167</span></a> Before the establishment of the Copyright Office in this Act, the Library employed 24 persons on copyright matters, not including the Librarian, only 5 fewer than were established under the 1897 Act. Responding to the ever growing number of applications, in 1900, Congress increased the number of clerks to 38 and added a messenger boy. The next year 9 more clerks were added. The 1898 Annual Report of the Librarian, S. Doc. No. 24, 55th Cong., 3d Sess. at 55, contains a list of questions to be asked during the examination of those applying for a position in the Copyright Office. These questions went to the accounting and recordation functions of the Office and did not include any questions as to whether a deposit constituted copyrightable subject matter, the examination role being one the Office had not yet generally assumed. <i>See</i> Chapter 16, text at note 77.</p>

<p class=FNText>       In the first decision regarding the Librarian’s refusal to register a work, United States v. Everson, 26 Wash. L. Rep. 546 (Sup. Ct. D.C. 1898), the court rejected an effort to compel, by mandamus, registration for a completely blank book. The court indicated at the same time, however, that “the act is mandatory.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Librarian has no discretion in relation to the matter of recording.”</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref168" name="_ftn168" title=""><span class=FNRef>168</span></a> Apparently, Solberg’s appointment had been a “done deal.” <i>See</i> 29 Cong. Rec. 317 (Dec. 19, 1896):</p>

<p class=FNText>       MR. DRAPER: If I may interrupt the gentleman a moment, I should like to be informed how the minor officers are now appointed in the Library, and how they have been appointed for years past, so as to understand this proposed change.</p>

<p class=FNText>       MR. QUIGG:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In theoretical practice the Librarian of Congress&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has made the appointments. In actual practice I do not think that has occurred.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do remember an incident in connection with the bill for the registration of copyright. I remember that when that bill was being considered by the House in the last Congress, before it got very far everybody knew who was to be the register of copyrights; and I remember that the bill did not make much progress until it was known who was to be the register of copyrights; and I suspect the policy has been for the Librarian to appoint as he thought it wise to do.</p>

<p class=FNText>       Mr. Quigg’s reference to an earlier bill presumably refers to H.R. 8211, 54th Cong., 1st Sess. (April 15, 1896) (bill to provide for a commissioner of copyrights and to revise the copyright laws). <i>See also</i> S. 425, 54th Cong., 1st Sess. (Dec. 5, 1895) (bill to provide for a register of copyrights). <i>See</i> Chapter 16, note 76 for a discussion of Solberg’s efforts to secure the Register’s position.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref169" name="_ftn169" title=""><span class=FNRef>169</span></a> Solberg’s long tenure may have placed him out of touch with changes in social mores. An article in an English journal reported that the (U.S.) National Women’s Party had objected to a decision by Solberg that a married woman should register her claim to copyright in her husband’s name. <i>See</i> 38 The Author, Playwright, &amp; Composer No. 3 at 87 col. 2 (Apr. 1927). Apparently in response to this decision, a bill was introduced providing that “registration of claims to copyright by married women shall not be held invalid or prejudiced by reason of being made or having been made in the maiden name of the author who claims copyright.” H.R. 15,546, 69th Cong., 2d Sess.(1926).</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref170" name="_ftn170" title=""><span class=FNRef>170</span></a> Act of March 3, 1897, 54th Cong., 2d Sess., 29 Stat. 694. This Act began as H.R. 10223, introduced by Mr. Fairchild on February 3, 1897. On February 5, the House Committee on Patents reported the bill with amendments, H.R. Rep. No. 2813, 54th Cong., 2d Sess. H.R. 10223 passed the House on February 9. On February 20, the Senate Committee on Patents reported the bill with amendments. On March 3, the Senate passed H.R. 10223 as amended, and the House agreed to the Senate amendments on the same day, with President McKinley signing the Act into law that day.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref171" name="_ftn171" title=""><span class=FNRef>171</span></a> Act of January 7, 1904, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 Stat. 4. For a decision under this Act, <i>see</i> Encyclopedia Brittanica Co. v. Werner Co., 135 F. 841 (C.C.D.N.J. 1905). Similar temporary protection was established for the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1913. Act of September 18, 1913, Pub. L. No. 63-14, 63d Cong., 1st Sess., 38 Stat. 112. Under this latter Act, both the Copyright Office and the Patent Office were directed to set up field stations in San Francisco to process applications. Copyright protection was to last until three years after the close of the exposition on December 4, 1915. Apparently due to the world war in Europe, only four certificates of registration were ever issued, and these were handled by the Patent Office field station, since, given the lack of interest, the Copyright Office was reluctant to send an employee. <i>See</i> 1915-1916 Annual Report of the Register of Copyrights, <i>reproduced in</i> 1916 Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress at 184-85.</p>

<p class=FNText>       By the Act of July 19, 1932, Pub. L. No. 72-294, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 47 Stat. 703, protection for foreign exhibitors at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair Centennial Celebration (“A Century of Progress”) was established. The term of protection was for the duration of the fair plus six months. No registrations were made under the Act, however. 1934 Annual Report of the Register of Copyrights at 11.</p>

<p class=FNText>       Two resolutions were approved in 1937 for the benefit of foreign exhibitors at international expositions. On May 28, 1937, legislation was passed protecting works of foreign exhibitors at the Golden Gate International Exposition to be held in San Francisco in 1939, with protection lasting for the duration of the exposition plus six months, P. Res. 35, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 50 Stat. 211. When the exposition was postponed one year, the resolution was reintroduced and passed, substituting the new date. Act of April 22, 1940, P. Res. 62, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 54 Stat. 157. An identical law was enacted on June 11, 1937, P. Res. No. 41, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 50 Stat. 254, for the benefit of foreign exhibitors at the New York World’s Fair of 1939. In 1938, the same provisions were enacted for the benefit of exhibitors at the Pacific Mercado International Exposition, held in Los Angeles in 1940. Act of May 3, 1938, P. Res. 100, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 51 Stat. 593. Copyright Office records cited in the Register’s annual reports do not show registrations under any of these acts.</p>

Because the Act only extended ad interim protection to works in a foreign language, it was of no help to Canada and Great Britain, who were the largest suppliers of foreign books. As a result, §35(3) of the 1911 English Act included a requirement that works be simultaneously published in Great Britain within 14 days. The 1921 Canadian Copyright Act (effective January 1, 1924) contained manufacturing clause provisions in §§14(1), 15, and 16.

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref179" name="_ftn179" title=""><span class=FNRef>179</span></a> This message read:</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in definition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit provision for many articles which, under modem reproductive processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public. Attempts to improve them by amendment have been frequent, no less than twelve acts for the purpose having been passed since the Revised Statutes. To perfect them by further amendment seems impracticable. A complete revision to them is essential. Such a revision, to meet modem conditions, has been found necessary in Germany, Austria, Sweden, and other foreign countries, and bills embodying it are pending in England and the Australian colonies. It has been urged here, and proposals for a commission to undertake it have, from time to time, been pressed upon Congress.</p>

<p class=BlockQuote>    The inconveniences of the present conditions being so great, an attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by the Copyright Office, which has called conferences of the various interests especially and practically concerned with the operation of the copyright laws. It has secured from them suggestions as to the changes necessary; it has added from its own experience and investigations, and it has drafted a bill which embodies such of these changes and additions as, after full discussion and expert criticism, appeared to be sound and safe. In form this bill would replace the existing insufficient and inconsistent laws by one general copyright statute. It will be presented to the Congress at the coming session. It deserves prompt consideration.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref203" name="_ftn203" title=""><span class=FNRef>203</span></a> The notice requirement was revised to consist of the word “Copyright,” or the abbreviation “Copr.,” accompanied by the name of the copyright proprietor. The date of first publication was required for printed literary, musical, or dramatic works. For pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, the notice could consist of ©, accompanied by the initials, monogram, mark, or symbol of the copyright proprietor, provided the name of the proprietor was also placed or enumerated on other accessible places on the copy.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref204" name="_ftn204" title=""><span class=FNRef>204</span></a> The importance of deposit under the 1909 Act is seen in Sections 12 and 13. Section 12 provided, in relevant part, that no action for infringement could be brought until the deposit requirement had been satisfied. Section 13 stated that the failure to comply with the Register of Copyrights’ demand for deposit copies would result in a fine of $100 and twice the cost of the retail price of the best edition of the work, and, more importantly, forfeiture of copyright. The deposit requirement was increased to the providing of two copies of the “best edition” of the work; this provision had been objected to by publishers since the Librarian of Congress also requested (and obtained) the authority to transfer or sell copies to other libraries, or, to simply destroy unwanted copies. <i>See</i> Sections 59-60. The Library somewhat ameliorated the potential harshness of these provisions by agreeing to return, on request, unwanted deposit copies.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref205" name="_ftn205" title=""><span class=FNRef>205</span></a> Under Section 12, registration was made a prerequisite to the bringing of an infringement action; under prior law, affixation of notice was the only prerequisite.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref206" name="_ftn206" title=""><span class=FNRef>206</span></a> Under the 1891 Act, only the type or plates from which the work was printed or reproduced had to be manufactured in the United States; the actual printing could be done outside the country. Under the 1909 Act, the actual printing had to be done in the United States. A new requirement of binding in the United States was added. The term for ad interim protection of English-language books and periodicals first published abroad was set at only 30 days from the date of deposit in the Copyright Office. Section 16 of the 1909 Act also required the filing of an affidavit of compliance, while Section 17 made the filing of a false affidavit a misdemeanor. Import prohibitions were contained in Sections 31-33.</p>

<p class=FNText><a href="#_ftnref207" name="_ftn207" title=""><span class=FNRef>207</span></a> Berne did, nevertheless, have an effect on the United States’ international relations. Section 1(e) of the 1909 Act required a special finding by the President, before issuing a proclamation granting foreign authors protection, that the author’s country granted U.S. musical authors mechanical reproduction rights. Article 13 of the Berne Convention, as revised by the 1908 Berlin Conference, granted such rights to authors of musical works, and thus, as noted by the Register of Copyrights in his 1910-1911 annual report, provided a sufficient basis to satisfy Section 1(e)’s requirement. 1910-1911 Annual Report of the Register of Copyrights at 16.</p>

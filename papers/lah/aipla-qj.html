<h2>I. Introduction</h2>

<p>In the over two decades since the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Gottschalk v. Benson</em><a href="#N_1_">[1]</a>
questioning the patentability of computer software, the courts have tried to articulate when a
software-based invention is proper subject matter under section 101 of the patent statute.<a href="#N_2_">[2]</a>  But
because the courts can only judge the cases brought to them and interpret the existing intellectual
property laws, the courts are ill-suited for determining both how software should be protected and
how patent protection interrelates with copyright and other intellectual property protection for
software.

<p>Now, the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") has weighed in with its <em>Examination Guidelines
for Computer-Related Inventions</em>.<a href="#N_3_">[3]</a>  Unfortunately, the executive branch is even less capable of
resolving how to properly protect computer software than the judicial branch.  The guidelines,
quite properly, only address the PTO's view on patentability of software-based inventions, and not
how such patents fit into the general scheme of intellectual property protection for software. 
Resolving such questions are beyond the authority of the PTO.

<p>It is time to act on the final advice given by Justice Douglas in <em>Benson</em>:  with respect to the proper
protection of software-based inventions, "considerable problems are raised which only committees
of Congress can manage."<a href="#N_4_">[4]</a>  

<p>Congress is the only branch of government that properly can address how software should be
protected by patents and that can coordinate patent protection with the other forms of protection. 
With three simple changes in the patent statute, Congress can clarify the patentability of
software-based inventions, provide proper protection for truly innovative software advances, and
preserve the important balance between user and developer rights provided by the copyright
statutes.

<h2>II. The Need For Software Patents</h2>

<p>Past commentators have questioned the need for, or advisability of, patents for software-based
inventions.<a href="#N_5_">[5]</a>  Some complaints express problematic situations with patents in general, such as
when someone who independently develops a patented invention is forced to stop practicing the
invention.  If those complaints have merit, Congress should address them by reforming the patent
system as a whole, not by excluding one area of technology.

<p>Critics have also stated that the term of a patent, 17 or 20 years,<a href="#N_6_">[6]</a> is far too long for a
fast-moving technology like computer software.<a href="#N_7_">[7]</a>  Most people view software development as
one of this country's most dynamic industries, and, in terms of growth and impact, these people
are right.  But much software development has not been particularly innovative.  If much of the
growth of the software industry is not due to innovation, what has caused its explosive growth? 
One answer is computer hardware, which continues to become more powerful and less expensive. 
Personal computers available at any appliance store have more power and better graphics than
systems found only in a few research labs a decade ago.

<p>Others who oppose software patents have pointed out that the software industry has flourished
without patent protection.<a href="#N_8_">[8]</a>  But a key question remains unresolved:  would patents have retarded
software development, or have caused that development to advance even more rapidly?<a href="#N_9_">[9]</a>

<p>Software developers spend much of their efforts reinventing the wheel because there is not an
adequate collection of how problems have been solved in the past.  Sometimes they will consult a
book on algorithms, but unlike other areas of technology, they will seldom conduct a literature
review before starting their work because there is little to find.  Until recently, patents were
discouraged and commercial developers kept their work secret.  Because most software products
do not reveal their underlying technology, the user never learns the techniques used to get
particular results.  Thus, even the wide distribution of a software package does not add to the
body of computer science knowledge.  For example, when using a word processor or spreadsheet,
the user does not learn the techniques used to get particular results.  An active patent system for
software-related technology would make these techniques known.  Then others could improve
upon a patent or "invent around" a patent by using new solutions.

<p>In other fields, there is a strong tradition of seeking patent protection that both reveals
technological advances and gives protection to those advances.  Those who do not apply for
patents may find that someone else has been granted the patent, and they will face expensive
litigation to establish their rights to practice the invention.<a href="#N_10_">[10]</a>  In this way, the patent system forces
disclosure of what normally would be kept secret in exchange for protecting that disclosure for a
limited time.

<p>Moreover, the concern over patent infringement could have accelerated the trend in the computer
system development industry towards using software modules purchased from other developers. 
Developers of electronic circuits only worry whether their overall designs infringe a patent, not
whether components that are used in that design are infringing.  This is because the suppliers of
the components indemnify them for any patent infringement by the component.<a href="#N_11_">[11]</a>  The use of
purchased modules or libraries not only minimizes concerns about patent infringement, but can
result in faster software development.  Further, because the module developer can spend more
effort producing a comprehensive program, greater capabilities or more efficient operations can
result.

<p>The latest programming trend is object-oriented programming using languages such as C++.<a href="#N_12_">[12]</a> 
Object-oriented programming is characterized by routines for manipulating data structures that
can be incorporated easily into either a higher-level object or a final program.  The patent system
provides protection that is well suited for object-oriented programming.  Truly innovative
techniques for manipulating a data structure can be protected as processes.  Purchasing an
appropriate object for use in the system being developed not only saves programming time, but
could provide indemnification against patent infringement for that portion of the system.<a href="#N_13_">[13]</a> 
Concern over patent infringement can encourage the use of object-oriented programming and
purchased objects and libraries.

<h2>III. Problems With Section 101 Rejections</h2>

<p>The past position of the courts and the PTO regarding whether software-related inventions were
statutory subject matter under section 101<a href="#N_14_">[14]</a> has created other problems.  Enterprising patent
practitioners tried to hide software-related inventions in obtuse language and unclear claims.<a href="#N_15_">[15]</a> 
Artificial hardware implementations of techniques were often given as alternatives for software
implementations to make the invention seem more like a conventional machine.<a href="#N_16_">[16]</a>  This has not
only made it more difficult for people to understand the teachings of the patents, it has made
accurate classification and searching more difficult.

<p>Section 101 practices specific to software-related inventions have also resulted in increased
pendency of applications and a lower level of scrutiny regarding novelty and nonobviousness. 
The time spent by an examiner on an application is limited.  The hours spent rejecting a section
101 claim and then reviewing the response from the applicant to the rejection may mean that the
examiner is left with less time to address the important section 102 and 103 questions.<a href="#N_17_">[17]</a> 

<p>But the past PTO position on software-related inventions has distorted more than just patent law. 
When patent protection, the traditional method of protecting a process or machine, was
questionable for software and not widely used, other forms of protection for the underlying
techniques and implementation structures of software were found.  The result, in decisions like
<em>Whelan v. Jaslow</em><a href="#N_18_">[18]</a> and the final district court decision in <em>Lotus v. Borland,</em><a href="#N_19_">[19]</a> was an attempt to
extend copyright protection to cover the "non-literal" aspects of a program.  This can result in
protection beyond that provided by the patent law, without disclosure or examination, and for a
much longer period of time.  But a working patent system for software-related inventions can
remove much of the need for protecting software by copyright beyond literal or near-literal
copying, resulting in less stretching of copyright protection.<a href="#N_20_">[20]</a> 

<h2>IV. The Guidelines To The Rescue?</h2>

<p>With the issuance of the <em>Examination Guidelines for Computer-Related Inventions</em>,<a href="#N_21_">[21]</a> the PTO
has accepted the patentability of most software-based inventions.  The guidelines effectively and
properly shift the emphasis during examinations of software-based inventions from consideration
of statutory subject matter to the determination of whether the invention is truly novel and
nonobvious.<a href="#N_22_">[22]</a>  But the guidelines also permit patents covering computer software that is stored
in conventional memory devices,<a href="#N_23_">[23]</a> creating uncertainties regarding the infringement of such a
patent whenever a user copies the software while normally using the software.

<h3>A. When Is A Floppy Disk An Article Of Manufacture?</h3> 

<p>It has long been recognized that a book unique only with regard to its content is not patentable. 
Protecting content is the province of copyright law even though there is no specific prohibition
against such protection in the patent statute.  Rather, a court-made "printed matter" doctrine
denies patentability to material whose only novelty is in its expression.<a href="#N_24_">[24]</a>  However, <em>In re
Gulack</em><a href="#N_25_">[25]</a> notes that the printed matter doctrine "stands on a questionable legal and logical
footing" in light of the requirement of section 103<a href="#N_26_">[26]</a> that a claim must be considered "as a
whole."<a href="#N_27_">[27]</a>  <em>In re Lowry</em><a href="#N_28_">[28]</a> refused to extend the printed matter doctrine to data structures stored
in conventional memory devices that could only be "processed by a machine."<a href="#N_29_">[29]</a>

<p>In <em>In re Beauregard,</em><a href="#N_30_">[30]</a><em> </em>IBM claimed an already-patented computer process stored in
conventional memory devices (e.g., floppy disks) as an article of manufacture made novel by the
stored computer process.<a href="#N_31_">[31]</a>  The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences had upheld the
examiner's rejection of the claims under the printed matter doctrine.<a href="#N_32_">[32]</a>  IBM appealed the
Board's decision to the Federal Circuit.  On April 26, 1995, the PTO altered its position and
moved for the dismissal of <em>Beauregard</em>, agreeing with IBM that the claimed subject matter was
patentable.<a href="#N_33_">[33]</a>  The PTO stated that they were "preparing guidelines for the patent examining
corps, advising the corps the computer programs embodied in a tangible medium, such as a floppy
diskette, are patentable subject matter."<a href="#N_34_">[34]</a>

<p>The Proposed Guidelines<a href="#N_35_">[35]</a> stated that "a computer-readable memory that can be used to direct a
computer to function in a particular manner when used by the computer is a statutory 'article of
manufacture.'"<a href="#N_36_">[36]</a>  However, because it is a man-made device, any memory device is an article of
manufacture, whether its contents can direct the functioning of a computer or not.  Under the
Proposed Guidelines, you would have had to look at the contents of a device, rather than just
observe that it is man-made and therefore an article of manufacture.<a href="#N_37_">[37]</a>

<p>The final guidelines take another approach:  to be statutory subject matter, an invention must not
only be a "machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or process," but also must be "useful."<a href="#N_38_">[38]</a> 
An invention is "useful" if it has "a practical application."<a href="#N_39_">[39]</a>  Usefulness or utility previously has
been used to limit the patentability of impossible inventions (e.g., perpetual motion machines),<a href="#N_40_">[40]</a>
ideas not reduced to practice,<a href="#N_41_">[41]</a> or chemical compounds with no known use other than further
research.<a href="#N_42_">[42]</a>

<p>Such a distinction works well for software-based inventions claimed either as a process or as a
machine running the software.  Implementations of technological applications are patentable, but
abstract functions are not.<a href="#N_43_">[43]</a>  However, the distinction becomes more complicated for memory
devices containing information.  In this case, the guidelines require that the information be
"functional" for it to be given any weight in determining whether the invention is novel and
nonobvious: "'functional descriptive material' consists of data structures and computer programs
which impart functionality when encoded on a computer-readable medium."<a href="#N_44_">[44]</a>


<h3>B. Computer Systems Have Two Distinct Types Of Memories</h3> 

<p>The Examination Guidelines are problematic because they do not recognize that there are two
distinct types of computer-readable memories:  executable memory that directly controls a digital
computer and repository memory from which a program must be transferred before it can control
a computer.

<p>Executable memory is the random-access memory ("RAM") or read-only memory ("ROM") that
is directly connected to the digital computer's instruction fetching and decoding circuitry.  This
memory provides the instructions that indicate the sequencing of the computer and the processing
of data also stored in the executable memory.  Programs in executable memory configure the
digital computer, transforming it into a new, special-purpose machine that operates in a specific
and predetermined manner.  Executable memory differs from a program repository because it
implicitly includes the digital computer processor that it directly controls.  Functionality is
imparted to the controlled digital computer only from information stored in executable memory.

<p>In contrast, programs in a repository memory, such as a hard disk or floppy disk, are merely data
for another computer program which loads them into the executable memory.  The programs do
not configure the computer until they have been loaded into executable memory.  In most cases, a
loader program must transform the programs into the form that can be executed by the computer
(e.g., linking to libraries, relocating addresses, and allocating data areas).  There is little difference
between the digital data representing programs stored in a repository memory and the digital data
representing the audio stored on a compact disc.  Both are data that are read and processed
digitally to bring about the desired results.  Information stored in repository memory does not
directly impart any functionality to a computer system.

<p>It is important that law be anchored in reality, and distinctions be drawn only where they actually
exist.  The "mathematical algorithm" distinction<a href="#N_45_">[45]</a> did not work well because there is no similar
distinction in computer science.  In contrast, the concept that a general purpose computer when
programmed becomes a new machine<a href="#N_46_">[46]</a> works well because the idea matches almost exactly the
concept of virtual machines discussed in operating systems classes.

<p>The Examination Guidelines make a distinction not anchored in computer science.  Rather than
recognize that the only memory where information is "functional" is executable memory, such as
RAM or ROM, the guidelines try to include repository memory as being able to hold functional
information.  However, the information stored in a repository memory does not impart
functionality to a digital computer until it has been loaded into executable memory.  Until then, it
is simply data, no different than "non-functional descriptive material" such as music, literary
works, or a compilation of factual data stored in the same medium.

<p>It is not surprising that the guidelines try to include computer programs when stored in repository
memory as functional and therefore patentable, since the PTO had already told the Federal Circuit
that the guidelines would be drafted in such a manner.  The PTO was prevented from drawing the
line between functional and non-functional where computer science dictates: between programs in
executable and repository memories.

<h2>V. The Effect On Copyright</h2>

<p>Although consideration should be given to the effect on copyright of patents for articles of
manufacture that are programs stored in repository memories, such consideration is clearly
outside the permissible scope of the PTO guidelines.  Because programs are works of authorship
stored in a tangible medium of expression, they are already protected by copyright.  Further,
copyright law not only provides protection to the author, but also provides rights to users.

<p>It is an infringement of a patent to make the patented invention.<a href="#N_47_">[47]</a>  Whenever the program is
copied, a new instance of the program stored in a memory is made.  If a memory storing a
particular program is patented, any copying results in a new instance of the program stored in
memory that infringes the patent.  For most inventions, a replicator capable of taking one instance
of a machine or manufacture and directly producing a new instance would be something out of
science fiction.  For a program stored in memory, the copy command on the computer system is
such a replicator.

<p>For example, if the program were originally stored on a floppy disk, as would be the case when it
is received from the software developer, another instance of the patented stored program is made
when the program is copied from the floppy disk onto a hard disk.  Another instance is made
whenever an archive copy of the hard disk is made.  Finally, each time the program is run it must
be copied from the hard disk into the RAM of the computer, making yet another instance of the
patented program stored in memory.

<p>The patent laws do not contain an equivalent to section 117 of the Copyright Act,<a href="#N_48_">[48]</a> which
permits copying of a computer program if it is a necessary step in its use.<a href="#N_49_">[49]</a>  Anyone copying a
program that includes a method that is the subject of a "program stored in memory" patent would
infringe that patent, no matter how minor the method is to the entire computer program.  This
would be similar to the situation where an automobile containing a patented screw infringes the
patent on that screw, even if the screw is an inconsequential part of the automobile.

<p>In addition, patent law does not provide an equitable balance between the legitimate rights of the
patent owner and the rights of users such as provided by "fair use" under section 107 of the
Copyright Act.<a href="#N_50_">[50]</a>  Most analogous to "fair use" is the patent exhaustion doctrine, which allows
the rightful owner of a patented device to use or sell that device.<a href="#N_51_">[51]</a>

<p>It might be argued that the patent exhaustion doctrine permits the making of new instances of
patented stored programs if such copies are necessary for the use of the software.  Nevertheless,
the patent exhaustion doctrine has never allowed the owner of one instance of a patented article
of manufacture to make another instance without the permission of the patent owner.  On the
contrary, there are many cases that try to resolve whether an apparatus is being repaired, not
making the invention, or rebuilt, making the invention and infringing the patent.<a href="#N_52_">[52]</a>  It is uncertain
whether a court would extend the patent exclusion doctrine to include the making of new
instances of stored programs.

<p>Patents on computer programs residing in memory devices could preempt many of the user rights
provided under the Copyright Act, particularly section 117.<a href="#N_53_">[53]</a>  By their nature, such patents will
be infringed as part of the normal and expected usage of the programs.  As a result, such patents
distort both the patent and copyright systems simply to provide an avenue for suing the producer,
instead of the end user, of a program that infringes a patented method.  A far better solution
would be to amend the patent laws to make the distribution of a computer program implementing
a patented method either a direct infringement or an inducement of infringement.

<h2>VI. A Legislative Solution</h2>

<p>By making three simple changes to the patent statute, Congress can clarify the patentability of
software-based inventions and enhance their protection.

<h3>A. A Computer Program Is A Process</h3> 

<p>The definition of process given in section 100(c) of the patent statute<a href="#N_54_">[54]</a> should be amended to
read as follows: 
<blockquote>
The term "process" means process, art or method, and includes <em>a process implemented in whole
or in part by a computer program or</em> a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,
composition of matter, or material.
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of a computer program found in the Copyright Act is also satisfactory here:  "A
'computer program' is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a
computer in order to bring about a certain result."<a href="#N_55_">[55]</a>

<p>The proposed language supplants all the confusing case law on software patentability, from
<em>Gottschalk v. Benson</em><a href="#N_56_">[56]</a> to the present.  In particular, it does not require that the computer
program change the state of some physical thing to be patentable,<a href="#N_57_">[57]</a> nor does it differentiate
between "mathematical algorithms" and other methods or algorithms for achieving a desired
result.<a href="#N_58_">[58]</a>

<p>  Simply implementing a previously-known process by a computer program would not result in a
patentable invention.  While the implemented process would be statutory subject matter, it would
not be patentable because an implementation of a known technique is obvious to a skilled
programmer.  Patentability would be determined by whether the invention is really a novel and
nonobvious advance, not how the invention can be classified.

<p>While some may question whether processes implemented by computer programs should be
statutory subject matter for patents,<a href="#N_59_">[59]</a> this amendment recognizes that since <em>Diamond v. Diehr</em><a href="#N_60_">[60]</a>
the PTO has issued tens of thousands of patents on computer-implemented processes. 
Furthermore, under the GATT/TRIPs Agreement,<a href="#N_61_">[61]</a> the United States has agreed not to
discriminate on the basis of a specific technology when determining patentability.<a href="#N_62_">[62]</a>

<p>True mathematical laws such as the quadratic equation, as well as other laws of nature, remain
unpatentable because they have no inventor.  Examiners should be able to recognize such laws
because they will be formulas which are always true, separate from a particular application, rather
than inventions for obtaining a particular result.  Processes based on mathematical laws or laws of
nature that are implemented by computer programs are patentable if they are novel and
nonobvious.

<p>While it would still be possible to characterize software-based inventions as either machines or as
articles of manufacture, this amendment makes it clear that the preferred claim is for a process or
method for achieving a particular result.  The claim is not for the computer program itself, but for
the process or method implemented by the computer program or a portion thereof.  It will no
longer be necessary to disguise a software patent by claiming the invention as a hardware system.

<p>The proposed language only allows claims for methods actually implemented on a computer, not
performed by a person, although such processes would still be patentable to the extent they were
patentable before the amendment.<a href="#N_63_">[63]</a>

<p>Such a claim recognizes that the digital computer system is not the novel part of the invention,
and allows the examiner to search for prior art that describes the particular steps of the method to
determine if the invention is novel and nonobvious.  It does not make an old method novel just
because it is implemented for the first time on a computer.

<h3>B. The Stored Information Exclusion</h3>  

<p>The problems with the guidelines<a href="#N_64_">[64]</a> previously discussed come from the PTO's position in <em>In re
Beauregard</em><a href="#N_65_">[65]</a> and the disfavor for non-statutory restrictions on patentability expressed by the
Federal Circuit.<a href="#N_66_">[66]</a>  However, it is just such a restriction that could provide the solution to the
difficulties detailed above.  The "printed matter" doctrine says that patentable weight is not given
to information stored in a medium unless there is some novel and nonobvious relationship
between the information and the medium.  As previously noted, the guidelines adopt a variation of
the printed matter doctrine, giving no weight to non-functional descriptive material.

<p>A stored information exclusion should be recognized by adding a new sentence to section 103's<a href="#N_67_">[67]</a>
standards for nonobviousness:
<blockquote>
Patentable weight shall not be given to information stored in a medium unless there is a novel and
nonobvious relationship between the information and the medium. 
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, Congress can indicate in the legislative history that it views with disfavor the
past non-statutory restrictions, such as "method of doing business" and "mental processes."<a href="#N_68_">[68]</a>

<p>Section 103 requires that claims must be considered "as a whole" and not dissected into their
component parts.<a href="#N_69_">[69]</a>  While considering the "point of novelty"<a href="#N_70_">[70]</a> in a claim may help an examiner
in searching for the best prior art, it has no place in determining the patentability of a claim.  The
stored information exclusion allows the examiner to consider separately whether the information
stored in memory has a patentable relationship to the memory and if not, consider the memory as
if it did not contain any particular information.

<p>With a stored information exclusion, there would be no need to look at the content of a storage
medium to determine if the medium is statutory subject matter.  It always will be, since it is a
man-made object.  There would be no need to determine if what is stored in the medium is
"functional" or "non-functional" in deciding whether an invention is statutory subject matter. 
However, in assessing the novelty and nonobviousness of an invention, whether stored
information is related to the medium would be considered to determine whether it should be given
any weight in assessing the invention.

<p>For example, a computer program stored in any memory device would not be given patentable
weight, since it has no relationship to the memory device beyond that of any other computer
program.  But a data encoding, used to increase the capacity or detect errors in a particular
storage device, would be considered by the examiner in determining whether an invention is
nonobvious.  The text of a book would not be given patentable weight, although the book would
be an article of manufacture.  DNA sequences stored in a cell would be given patentable weight to
the extent that the sequence defines the nature of the cell. 

<p>The stored information exclusion reinforces the complementary nature of patent and copyright,
particularly for computer software.  Copyright does not protect any "procedure, process, system,
[or] method of operation"--the subject matter of patents.<a href="#N_71_">[71]</a>  Under the stored information
exclusion, patents would not be available for information or expression unless there was a special
relationship to their storage medium.  Computer programs per se would be protected by
copyright; new methods used in computer programs would be protected by patent.

<p>This statutory change would also mean that data structures would not be patentable as an article
of manufacture when combined with an ordinary memory, overturning <em>In re Lowry</em>.<a href="#N_72_">[72]</a>  But novel
and nonobvious ways of organizing data would still be patentable as methods operating on a
computer.  It would be the techniques for accessing, creating, adding, and erasing the information
within the data structures that would be patentable, not the data structures themselves.  This
corresponds well to the concept in computer science of object-oriented programming, where an
object is not only a data structure (often hidden from the user), but a set of routines for creating,
accessing, changing, or removing the data structure.

<h3>C. True Protection For Novel Computer Programs</h3>

<p>One justification for a <em>Beauregard</em>-type patent on a memory device, like a floppy disk, storing a
novel and nonobvious computer program is that the conventional ways of claiming a
software-based invention did not provide proper protection against the true infringer.  If the
invention is claimed as a method, the claim is infringed only when the method is actually used.  If
the invention is claimed as a machine running the program, the claim is infringed only when the
program is actually loaded into the computer.  In both cases, it is the end user of the program who
is the actual infringer, and who may not be aware that use of the software infringes a patent.

<p>But the true infringer of the patent on the software-based invention is the competitor who
included the patented method in their software and sold it to the end user.  The competitor could
be accused of inducing or contributing to the infringement of the patent.  However, such an
accusation presents a number of problems.  For example, to be a contributory infringer, the
competitor must know that what they are producing will lead to an infringement; they must have
actual knowledge of the patent.<a href="#N_73_">[73]</a>

<p><em>Beauregard-</em>type claims attempt to get around these problems by claiming any memory device
containing the patented software method.  But as discussed above, such claims cause problems
because end users infringe the patent whenever they copy or use the program, and because such
claims base the patentability of a memory device on the intended use of its contents.

<p>These problems again point out the difficulty of trying to adapt the patent laws judicially or
administratively, rather than legislatively.  If it is desirable that people distributing software
containing a patented process be infringers, there are a number of ways section 271<a href="#N_74_">[74]</a> can be
amended.  For example, paragraph (a) can be expanded by adding a second sentence, such as the
following: 
<blockquote>
Distributing a computer program implementing a patented process infringes the patent on the
process.
</blockquote>
<p>Such language would be a far better approach than the <em>Beauregard</em>-type claim because it would
extend to any patented process.<a href="#N_75_">[75]</a>  Additional claims of memory devices containing programs that
implement the process would not be necessary (and would not be permitted under the amended
section 103,<a href="#N_76_">[76]</a> as discussed above).  Moreover, the infringement is tied to distribution, not to
production, use, or sale.  As such, users will not infringe the patent if they simply copy the
program to another memory device.  "Distributing" could have its common meaning, or a
definition could be added to section 100<a href="#N_77_">[77]</a> indicating that it includes not only sales, but any
transfers to another.  Because distributing can include not only the transfer of physical storage
media such as floppy disks, but also electronic transfer of computer programs over a data
network, this approach addresses future software distribution techniques not involving physical
objects.  Just as producers and sellers of infringing software would be liable for infringement, so
too would be the operator of a bulletin board system distributing pirated patented software.

<h2>VII. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Over two decades ago, in his <em>Gottschalk v. Benson</em><a href="#N_78_">[78]</a> decision, Justice Douglas called on
Congress to clarify the patentability of software-based invention.<em></em><em></em><a href="#N_79_">[79]</a> Decades of confusing court
decisions show that the problem cannot be handled adequately by the judicial branch.  Because the
problems extend beyond the issuance of patents and concern patent enforcement and other forms
of software protection, such as copyright, the PTO cannot adequately solve the problems through
examination guidelines.  Only legislation can adequately clarify the patent of software-based
invention.  Such legislation need not be complex.  This article suggests three simple amendments
to the current patent statute which clarify that computer-implemented processes are patentable,
exclude information stored in obvious ways in determining novelty, and protect those holding
patents on methods from those who distribute computer programs implementing those methods.

<p><a name="N_10_">10. </a> Even though the United States is one of the few countries with a "first to invent" patent
system, rather than a "first to file" system, unless the first inventors have kept excellent records of
their work from conception to reduction to practice, it is difficult for them to prevail in an
interference action or in court.  This is because, in an interference, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the parties made their inventions in the order of their filing dates.  The junior
party can overcome this presumption with a preponderance of the evidence unless the junior
application was filed after the issuance of a patent on the invention, in which case clear and
convincing evidence is required.

<p>Section 112 states that "means for" claim elements are to be construed to cover what is described

1189, 29 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc).  However, sometimes a
specification contains little or nothing describing the "means for" element.  <em>See</em> <em>In re</em> Trovato, 42

U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en banc).  The lack of descriptive material in the
specification makes these claims a "black hole" enveloping everything within the claim.  Such
black hole claims should be rejected under section 112, since they are not "particularly pointing
out and distinctly claiming" the invention.  35 U.S.C.  112.

was addressing a process not tied to a particular machine.  This is noted in <em>Benson</em>, where Justice
Douglas indicates that "[t]ransformation and reduction of an article 'to a different state thing' is
the clue to the patentability of a process claim that <em>does not include particular machines.</em>"  409

<p>This is merely a restatement of the principle that patents apply to the technical arts, because they
address either particular machines or compositions of matter, or processes that produce a physical
change.  A computer program, as opposed to an abstract algorithm, is always in the technological
arts, because it operates on a particular machine--the special-purpose computer formed by
programming a general-purpose computer to perform the specified function.  <em>See In re </em>Alappat,
33 F.3d 1526, 1545, 31 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1545, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

<p>State Street Bank and Trust v. Signature Financial, 927 F. Supp. 502, 38 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA)
1530 (D. Mass. 1996), turned the principle of <em>Cochrane</em> on its head.  The patent in suit was
claimed as an apparatus, specifically a digital computer having the means for performing a
specified sequence of operations.  The court first determined that, because the sequence of
operations could run on any digital computer, the claimed apparatus should be viewed instead as a
process.  It then determined that the resulting process did not involve a physical transformation,
and was therefore not statutory subject matter.  But the claimed invention is a particular machine,
and therefore clearly in the technological arts and statutory subject matter.

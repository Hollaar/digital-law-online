This paper discusses the problems with current patents, especially for 
fast-moving technologies, and proposes a new, intermediate form of protection 
as a solution. An example based on the Amazon &quot;one-click&quot; patent illustrates 
how current patent protection is &quot;too much, too long, too late.&quot;</p>


<p>
In particular, the protection would be for four years and would come into being 
after filing of an application containing a disclosure of the technology and 
appropriate claims, receiving a registration number, and using the technology in 
commerce marked with the registration number. Novelty would be required, and 
substantial independent creation would be a defense.</p>


<p>
At the same time this alternative protection is adopted, the requirements for 
getting a utility patent could be strengthened. A substantial increase in 
application fees could support the level of examination warranted by the 
protection given by a patent. And we could go from a system where &quot;A 
person shall be entitled to a patent <i>unless</i>&quot; to one where
&quot;A person shall be entitled to a patent <i>if</i>&quot; 
stringent conditions were met.</p>

<p>
How the proposal would be beneficial to software developers is discussed in
&quot;<a href="eupaco2.pdf">Why  Software Developers Should Support a New, Limited Patent</a>,&quot;
presented at EUPACO-2, The European Patent Conference, Brussels, May 15-16 2007.</p>

An earlier version of the paper was published as &quot;<a href="jptos-mini-patent.pdf">A 
New Look at Patent Reform</a>&quot; in the 
September 2005 issue of <i>Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office 
   Society</i>. The <a href="mini-patent-2006-04-20.pdf">April 20, 2006</a> and
<a href="mini-patent-2006-05-19.pdf">May 19, 2006</a> revisions of that paper is also available.</p>


<p>
An <a href="mp-comparison.pdf">addendum to that paper</a> discusses the proposal in light of a tier 
examination scheme proposed by Profs. Mark Lemley, Doug Lichtman, and Bhaven Sampat and Ben Klemens' call for ending software patents and reverting to copyright only.</p>

A short piece based on the paper, &quot;<a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/feb06/2785">Patents 
2.0: A new type of patent is needed</a>,&quot; was published in the February 2006 
issue of <i>IEEE Spectrum.</i></p>

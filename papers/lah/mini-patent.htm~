This paper discusses the problems with current patents, especially for 
   fast-moving technologies, and proposes a new, intermediate form of protection 
   as a solution. An example based on the Amazon &quot;one-click&quot; patent illustrates 
how current patent protection is &quot;too much, too long, too late.&quot;</p>


<p>
The current version of the paper adds a section at the end, &quot;Comparison to other 
suggested approaches,&quot; that discusses the proposal in light of a
<a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv28n4/v28n4-noted.pdf">tier 
examination scheme</a> proposed by Profs. Mark 
Lemley, Doug Lichtman, and Bhaven Sampat and the Ben Klemens' call for ending software patents and reverting to copyright only.</p>


<p>
An <a href="jptos.pdf">earlier version of the paper</a> was published in the 
September 2005 issue of <i>Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office

<p>
The prosecution history for the application that was the subject of <i>Diamond 
v. Diehr</i> at the Supreme Court in 1981 (<a href="http://digital-law-online.info/cases/209PQ1.htm">450 
U.S. 175</a>) provides an example of how concentrating on Section 101 (statutory 
subject matter) can result in less time spent on the important Sections 102 
(novelty) and 103 (obviousness) considerations.</p>


<p>
After the decision by the Supreme Court, United States Patent
<a href="US4344142.pdf">4,344,142</a> was granted on August 10, 1982. 
Application 602,463 was a continuation of 472,595, which was abandon, and a 
continuation-in-part of 401,127, also abandon. (Those prosecution histories have 
not been reviewed by Professor Hollaar, but will be at a later date and any 
relevant information included here.)</p>


<p>
Prosecution of the '463 application began with a <a href="Initial.pdf">
preliminary amendment</a> and some minor changes to the specification. It 
responded to the last office action on the parent '595 application, particularly 
the examiner's rejection under Section 112 for insufficient disclosure and 
Section 101 for non-statutory subject matter. Whatever prior art the examiner 
had previously cited was no longer an issue. &quot;Applicants infer that the Examiner 
has now recognized the unobvious differences of the present invention over the 
cited prior art and that the issue is to Sections 101 and 112.&quot; The applicants 
also provided a number of affidavits directed to the issue of the sufficiency of 
the disclosure and to remove a cited reference by showing an earlier date of 
reduction to practice and diligence in filing the application.</p>


<p>
In his next <a href="OfficeAction.pdf">office action</a>, the examiner continued 
to reject the claims based on Sections 101 and 112. He also cited five patents 
as being &quot;of interest but are not applied against the claims.&quot; (These may be 
patents already cited in the prosecution of the parent applications. No other 
prior art, except for a patent cited first in the notice of allowance, is listed 
on the issued patent.)</p>


<p>
The applicants responded with another <a href="Amendment.pdf">amendment</a> and 
affidavit, convincing the examiner on the Section 112 issue but not Section 101. 
The examiner made the action final, and the applicants <a href="Appeal.pdf">
appealed</a> to the Board of Patent Appeals and Inferences, which affirmed the 
examiner.</p>


<p>
The case then went to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), which
<a href="Courts.pdf">reversed</a> the Board, and then to the Supreme Court, 
which <a href="Courts.pdf">affirmed</a> the CCPA. Except for a short notice of 
appeal, none of the pleadings in those courts are in the prosecution history.</p>


<p>
After the case was remanded to the examiner, the applicant filed another
<a href="AfterAmendment.pdf">amendment</a> to clarify the claims because it was 
felt &quot;the claims do not <u>literally</u> say what everyone involved up to now 
has interpreted them as meaning.&quot;</p>


<p>
The examiner then <a href="Allowance.pdf">allowed</a> all the pending claims. In 
his single-page reasons for allowance, he distinguished the claimed invention 
from one prior art reference by noting that it &quot;does not disclose the continuous 
comparison of a calculated total required cure time value with elapsed time.&quot; He 
also introduced a new prior art patent, related to one previously cited, but 
didn't find it relevant because it described taking the temperature using &quot;a 
probe which projects into the mold&quot; as opposed to the claimed &quot;at a location 
closely adjacent to the mold cavity.&quot;</p>


<p>
The entire file wrapper, except for the initial specification (which is 
essentially the same as that in the patent), the issued patent, and papers 
related to fees and notices of appeal, is available <a href="Whole.pdf">here</a>.</p>

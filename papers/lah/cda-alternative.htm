<h3 align="center"><a href="cda-alternative-paper.html">Congress: Don't censor the internet,<br>
but help users avoid unwanted
material.</a></h3>
<p>
<font size="2">In 1997, at the time the Supreme Court 
<a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-511.ZS.html">struck down</a> the
<a href="cda.html">Communications Decency Act</a> (CDA) as an unconstitutional 
restraint on free speech, I wrote a <a href="cda-alternative-paper.html">paper</a> 
and <a href="nlj-cda-piece.html">opinion piece</a> indicating an alternative 
approach that Congress could adopt that does not have the constitutional 
difficulties of the CDA.</font></p>


<p>
<font size="2">I proposed criminalizing knowingly 
misrepresenting a work by attaching a fraudulent content rating. There are 
already similar provisions regarding trademarks and certification marks. The 
proposed law would not require anyone to rate the content of their work, but 
would punish those who intentionally misrate a work. The law would not only 
cover Web content, but also email and newsgroups, allowing the development of 
rating schemes that would indicate the nature of a message so that spam could be 
filtered. It's a way for Congress to support the efforts of good Internet 
citizens to bring some order to things, instead of trying to regulate the 
Internet.</font></p>


<p>
<font size="2">Instead of following the approach of my paper, Congress adopted a 
CDA-like law, the Child Online Protection Act (47 U.S. C. §231), which the 
Supreme Court has
<a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-218.ZS.html">also found</a> 
was too restrictive of free speech. But the Court seemed to endorse filtering 
technology, and my proposed approach enhances the ability of filters.</font></p>


<p>
<font size="2">Although there have been some changes in the law since the paper 
was written seven years ago, including the enactment of a prohibition on 
misleading Internet domain names (18 U.S.C. §2252B,
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ021.108">
Public Law 108-21</a>) and the CAN-SPAM Act, (15 U.S.C. §7701<i> et seq, </i>
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ187.108">
Public Law 108-187</a>), the proposal still makes sense. So, rather than update 
the paper to discuss the latest Supreme Court decision and the new laws,
<a href="cda-alternative-paper.html">here it is</a> in its original form.</font></p>


<p>
<font size="2">Maybe the third time will be the charm.</font></p>

The USPTO can address many of its examination problems by bringing its current system for 
determining examiner performance into the 21st Century. There is no need to 
continue the current coarse-grained “count” system, which may have made sense 
when records were kept with paper and pencil, but has no justification now. It 
has been said that the measure determines the system, and that is certainly the 
case here.</p>

<p>Equally archaic is the patent fee structure, developed to make 
it easy for an applicant to determine the amount of the check included with the 
application. While there is a surcharge for long applications and claims beyond 
20, that is only a very limited approximation of the effort required to examine 
the application. And even those surcharges aren’t considered when determining 
examiner performance. </p>

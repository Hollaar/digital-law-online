With the Supreme Court's
<a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-480.ZO.html">unanimous 
opinion</a> in <i>
<a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-480.ZS.html">MGM v. 
Grokster</a></i>, this paper shifts from an advocacy piece to a historical work. 
The Court made clear that inducement is part of copyright law, as the paper 
first suggested:</font></p>

For the same reasons that 
<a href="http://digital-law-online.info/cases/220PQ665.htm">Sony</a> took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as 
a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a 
sensible one for copyright. We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a 
device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by 
clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is 
liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.</p></font>


<p>
<font size="2"><i>Sony Revisited</i> was perhaps the first paper to examine whether inducement of copyright infringement 
is part of United States copyright law in light of <i>Sony</i> and other 
decisions. It not only took a new look at the<i> Sony</i> decision, but also<i>
</i>looked at how <i>Sony</i> came about by reviewing the drafts of the opinion 
and dissent, the briefs and oral arguments, and the correspondence between the 
justices as the decision developed.</font></p>

Two earlier versions of the paper are available in addition to the
<a href="sony-revisited.pdf">current version</a>. The <a href="sony-revisited-june6.pdf">June 6, 2004 
version</a> was the first version that was generally available.&nbsp;The <a href="sony-revisited-august26.pdf">August 26, 2004 version</a>, included 
a discussion of 
<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:s.2560:">S. 2560</a>, the 
Induce Act, which is unlikely to be reintroduced in Congress.
Also available is my <a href="grokster-amicus.pdf">amicus brief</a> in <i>
Grokster</i>, based on this paper.</p>

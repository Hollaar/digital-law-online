<p class="Paragraph">Clear and convincing evidence is the current standard of 
proof necessary to invalidate an issued patent. Not only is the wholesale 
application of clear and convincing evidence to all forms of invalidity 
determination, even when the evidence has not been considered by the examiner 
disturbing from the standpoints of logic and basic fairness, it also appears to 
have come about largely through overextending an early Supreme Court decision, 
with little justification given.</p>


<p>This paper reviews how the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidentiary standard came 
about, and finds its development anything but clear and convincing. It looks at 
the problems caused, including making it easier for &quot;patent trolls&quot; to scare 
legitimate companies with dubious patents. It suggests an alternative 
evidentiary standard, giving deference only to the fact-finding made by the 
Patent Office, and indicates how will promote sound policy objectives.</p>


<p>This paper is one of two papers that form the basis for Professor Hollaar's <a href="../lah/KSR-amicus.pdf">
amicus brief</a> to the Supreme Court 
   in the <i>KSR v. Teleflex</i> patent case. The second is also by his research 
assistant, John Knight: &quot;<a href="tsm.htm">The 
   Motivation for the Federal Circuit Test</a>.&quot;</p>


<p>The <a href="unclear-v1.pdf">August 25, 2006</a>, and 
<a href="unclear-v2.pdf">September 23, 2006</a> versions of the paper is 
still available.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) test is currently 
used by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to determine 
if two or more prior art references can legitimately be combined during the 
§&nbsp;103 obviousness inquiry. The TSM test enjoys a long, rich history predating 
the Federal Circuit, and even its predecessor, the United States Court of Customs 
and Patent Appeals (CCPA).&nbsp;With the changing conceptions of 
“invention/obviousness,” originally coined “invention” and later codified as 
“obviousness,” the TSM test coevolved. The primary benefit of this coevolution 
is a test for obviousness that operates in a manner consistent with the 
principles of <i>Graham</i> while at the same time providing a pragmatic method 
which could be used in proceedings of the patent office and courts alike.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The TSM test was identified early-on as one method of 
evaluating the legitimacy of combining multiple references. The other important 
recurring concepts relevant to “invention/obviousness” were also identified 
surprisingly early; most before 1900. However, consistent use of the TSM test 
would not come about until much later starting in the Court of Customs and 
Patent Appeals.&nbsp; It is fair to say increased reliance on the TSM test is largely 
in response to the pernicious problem of hindsight reconstruction.&nbsp; As patent 
litigation continued to evolve in the CCPA and then Federal Circuit, so did the 
rigor with which the TSM test was consistently applied.&nbsp; Applied rigorously, the 
TSM test proved to be a valuable tool for reaching rational, defensible 
obviousness determinations consistent with <i>Graham</i> while avoiding 
hindsight reconstruction.</p>
<p>The elegance of 
the TSM test can best be appreciated by tracing its development, and observing 
TSM’s development as the courts consistently battled with hindsight 
reconstruction.</p>

amicus brief</a> to the Supreme Court 
   in the <i>KSR v. Teleflex</i> patent case. The second is &quot;<a href="unclear.htm">Unclear and Unconvincing:
How a misunderstanding led to the heightened evidentiary requirement in patent litigation</a>&quot;
